      "text": "where I really think taproot shines. So just kind of laying the groundwork there with Lightning Network is why I think tap route is massively valuable. And one of the big things that it's going to enable is that we won't be able to see what is a Lightning Channel and what is not anymore. We will not be able to just point at the bitcoin chain and be like, this is a Lightning Channel. This is a lightning channel. Opening, opening, opening, closing, closing, closing. This is how big the Lightning Network is. That is the Lightning Network is going to get harder and harder to tell what the hell is going on because tap root enables obscuring all of the signature and script data. So I talked about earlier that if you have a single from address and a to address and I just have one key signing it, that's one signature. Well, if I have a one address to from address to a two address and I have a two of three multi SIG, it shows all three of the signatures that need to be met and has a little script that says if two, then you're good to go. This is valid if two of three and then signatures underneath it is met. So that's a lot of data. Tap, root and snore signatures. This is essentially what makes tap root possible. It's a new signature scheme. Makes it possible to have all of that be a single signature. And whether or not two people signed it, whether or not one person signed it, whether or not 50 people signed it, it is still a single signature, and it looks identical to any other tap root transaction. So if it's a multi signature, two of two with a lightning channel, doesn't look any different than a regular transaction. If it's a five of seven vault transaction with a standard five or seven multi SIG and then a time lock clause that if it's not met after 100 days. You can unlock it with this two of three signature. All of that wrapped up into a single. Like what would be normally a really long. Incredibly data heavy signature and script looks like any other transaction. Just a single script and whatever inputs to whatever outputs would look just as if one person signed it. And now some people say, oh, goody scaling. We can fit a couple more transactions in per block. I don't care about that. I mean, it's cool. Great. Cheaper transactions, also very good. This is a decent improvement. We want to be as efficient as possible with how much data we have to put on chain. But the two places where this really shines are validation time, the amount of computation it takes to prove that the signature has been met. I mean, think about it. If you've got a five of seven, you have to validate five things if it's signed properly and then run through the whole script, whatever it is, tap root, not only is the signature itself faster to validate, but it's only one signature. So if you've ever done a full sync of a bitcoin node, you know that the first 200,000 blocks fly. Like, just fly. Why? Because they're mostly empty. They're just barely a handful of transactions. You know, it's only like block I don't know, what was it? Shit, I'm not going to know. When the Genesis transaction was made, when the very first transaction was made to how. And I'm very upset. I have failed as Guy Swan. I have fallen from the throne. I'm going to have to go to my own calendar on the crypto economy.com calendar, alright? And command F transaction. There you are. Genesis transaction day, block 170. All this for just a random side point. Block 170 was the very first transaction that happened where Satoshi sent to halfini ten bitcoin. So this and the incredibly light, almost nonexistent use of bitcoin for the first 200,000 or so blocks, they just fly in the sync process because there's so little data to validate. And it's just easy. The computer just zips right through it. But then you start getting into like blocks 300,000 and stuff, and you're starting to see blocks all consistently have transactions and some big transactions like start to come in. And then you'll notice when you're in 4000 and 5000, it's slowing to a crawl. That's because you have to validate it all. You have to validate all the signatures, you have to run through all the scripts and all this stuff. And of course, the blocks got bigger too. So this was one of the things about SegWit that was actually kind of contentious, was that it does add a lot more data to validate, and this threatens Bitcoin's decentralization. It threatens the network resilience to recover. If a bug happens or something, bunch of nodes go down, or if there's a great firewall of China lockdown on being able to send Bitcoin information like et cetera, et cetera. We want to be able to bring up brand new nodes in the case that something goes wrong, or in the case that we add 20 million users. You don't want them to be dependent on the same. You want subsequently a ton more nodes when there are a ton more users on the network. Otherwise it's increasingly getting centralized to just bitcoin maximalists validating the network. And we don't want that. We want everyone to be validating. The network, all services, all businesses, everybody who has a substantial amount of savings. We want as many nodes as possible, so that's continuing to get harder and continuing to require more and more computational power is not a good thing. This is where Tap root ",

I mean, maybe I don't disclose that, but I just meant design space. So we know, of course, that Taproot's focus was on increasing Privacy, security and thorough put at the Bitcoin core protocol layer. But a consequence of that was that there can be more sophisticated, smart contracts on Bitcoin on layer two. And I expect that in 2022 we will see use cases develop around that new potential, including new sorts of forms of payments. And so it's just interesting to me, and I think it's really important to note that what seems like a small change at the protocol level can have an incredibly significant impact on the design space once developers start to play around with the new capabilities. Yeah. And I think this will kind of close a branch that was extended a long time ago when all ICO has happened. The question that the market so far hasn't really answered is what is going to come home to roost on Bitcoin? And that's kind of what I'm most curious to see. It's often positive that Bitcoin will steal whatever great ideas emerge in the crypto market at large. But outside of Lightning, we haven't seen too much of that. And I think if I understand what you're saying is through Tap root, this is now getting easier and easier to imagine. Right. So I don't see it in this way. I don't see it as stealing from other protocols. I see it as just taking some work as a venture capital fund. What we're looking for is founders that understand the underlying protocol technologies and can make use of them to create value for a new market, a new population. And so with Taproot, what I'm seeing is founders really be creative with what the design space means for them what it means for the populations they serve. So as an example, something I've talked about before is the ability to have what looks like a stablecoin transaction on Lightning, which perhaps would be done through the development of a stable channel defined by a DLC that would address an immediate need for folks that had adopted lightning in El Salvador or other emerging markets. And that's possible. That begins to become possible because of Taproot. So I don't know that that's pulling from another protocol or that. It's just that, frankly, in Bitcoin and Lightning, we're really benefited by having some of the most ambitious, most insightful founders in the world looking at what's possible on this tech. But that said, you're talking about porting ideas from other protocols, and that is certainly happening too. So I often give the example of Atomic Finance and what's interesting here and there are other companies like Atomic Finance, for instance, like a Bitmatrix. What's interesting with these sorts of companies is that rather than porting ideas from other protocols, they use the fact that other protocols might lead with capability versus secured instability like Bitcoin does. If they're leading with sort of like what you can do on the platform, then founders can use that as a test bed for what they'll later be able to do on Bitcoin with Bitcoin unlocks the same sort of capabilities. That's exactly what Atomic Finance did. That's exactly what Bitmatrix did. So Bitmatrix is building an AMM on Liquid, but while they were waiting for the necessary opcodes to be available on Liquid, they were testing out what they were going to build on alternative protocols. And so I think for that reason, in that way, Bitcoin is benefited. Bitcoin innovation is benefited. ",

      "text": "some tap root, man. Like, you've got the hashtag in your Twitter handle now, hashtag tap root 2020. So I did the same and want to try to spread that idea around. We need to get this thing going. Right. So why is tapper so important to get out sooner than later? I genuinely think that I still want a lot of new development and new features to come to the Bitcoin chain, like on chain, that obviously would require softworks. But as far as authentication of the code goes, I think if we got tap root, I would be okay with Ossifying after that if we couldn't get anything else in. Because I think what's increasingly going to happen is that contracts and signatures and the scripts that are involved in these things and the encumbrances of attaching a public key or signing with a hash of some other data or some other secret or the output of some other program or something into the signature of a transaction. I think those things are going to become so widespread that it's important that we make those as efficient. Private. And capable as possible. Absolutely. And right now, you basically have to tell the Bitcoin chain all of the possible scripts. You have to write this huge tree, and you have to publish this whole tree to the Bitcoin blockchain, which means it costs a fortune. It's a massive data hog. And more importantly, not only is it a data hog that's expensive for the person issuing the transaction, but it's also a huge burden on the computation of validating the chain. Yes. After you get to multi SIG and like Lightning network and all of these transactions. While you're syncing up a node. All the empty blocks up to block 200,000 or something like that go in like an hour. They like it just plows through all of them. And then it starts to slow down for another 200,000 when blocks are kind of full and you're getting full like 1 MB blocks and stuff. And we're kind of getting to that period where transactions are really heavy, but then you kind of get into the complex transactions and those last blocks, just your computer has to churn. It really slows down as time goes on because transactions are getting more and more complex. Cap root is both a huge boost to the validation. It's a huge efficiency and cost savings to the chain in not having to publish all of that scripting data, not having to tell the chain all of the crap that you're doing behind it. And it's a huge benefit to privacy because you're not showing all of that, all of those explicit paths in the transaction or the Multi SIG or the Lightning channel or whatever the hell it is you're doing to the transparent public blockchain. You're using it for the very thing that it's supposed to be used for securing the monetary policy period and securing the monetary policy and the ownership of the coins. And you don't have to show who's owning it or who has the signature power or who has the backup and the insurance clause in that signature power. You don't need any of that. And Tap root turns all of that into a single public key and a single signature. It hides all of it with Mast, with the mercalized abstract syntax trees, blah blah, where you create this off of the transaction, off of the chain, everything. You create this tree of possible paths that you have of the multi signal contracts in the Lightning case, you have the cooperative close potential, the insurance closed potential, and the punishment clause, you have these three different branches. Well, you put all that together and you give the root hash of all of that and mix that with the signatures and produce one public key and one signature, and it looks identical to any other one to one transaction on the chain period. You see none of it, and therefore, also you have to validate none of it. You. Just check the hash, you just boom it. Validation becomes so freaking cheap. And the ability, the things that you can do with that are you just open up a whole new world and you can really start to breaking down like one UTXO into ownership of many different parties. You really simplify, splicing in and splicing out of all the Lightning Channel opening, closing, splicing looping, all of that shit becomes so much easier, more private, more private. Lightning Network goes completely dark. You can't even use a Lightning Network Explorer anymore. You can't look at the chain and know what's lightning and what's not, which kind of sucks, but it's awesome. And what's funny is that it actually doesn't come with the usual trade offs. Usually you get one benefit at the cost of something else, or it takes a little bit longer to validate, but you get all these great features in the transaction, or you get all these awesome features, but it costs a little bit more in data. Usually there's always something that is the negative side of it, and Taproot has managed to almost have no negative. I think the only thing is that to do a certain type of transaction or to differentiate it, it takes like one bit, like literally one bit or one bite. I can't remember what it was. And they had to decide where and how exactly to put in that bite to kind of mitigate that one thing. And that was actually contentious, believe it or not, to figure out how to manage that one tiny little difference. Love it. But it's just good across the board, better for efficiency, better for the block space, and better for privacy. And if we can get that into the bitcoin code base. I think what we can do with that opens up enough possibility that bitcoin could work almost indefinitely with a layer two and layer three protocols and be incredibly secure. Not open us up to all these new risks and still be pretty damn feature rich and get back enough privacy at the base layer to enable privacy for the normal retail payment system. For a global payment system. Yeah. So awesome, man. I mean, can you give us a couple of examples of proposals that are reliant on the Top Group software? Well, I'm not sure if signature aggregation, because it's more signatures, is kind of the base of Tap root. So it's like VIP 391-4141 I can't remember. I can't remember what the numbers are, but it's like three of them in one SAP root, and then the verification and then Snore signatures and Mast, I. Think, is in there too. Yeah. Really? All the proposals that are wait a second. Is the vault actually a consequence of do you know the callback function? Like the vault? Is that from a different opcode? Is that from oh, God, I should have read about this again recently. It's been a long time since I since I read mastering bitcoin that's been taken many years. So I put most of that information aside, the details of the opcodes and everything. Yeah, ",

          "text": "some tap root, man. Like, you've got the hashtag in your Twitter handle now, hashtag tap root 2020. So I did the same and want to try to spread that idea around. We need to get this thing going. Right. So why is tapper so important to get out sooner than later? I genuinely think that I still want a lot of new development and new features to come to the Bitcoin chain, like on chain, that obviously would require softworks. But as far as authentication of the code goes, I think if we got tap root, I would be okay with Ossifying after that if we couldn't get anything else in. Because I think what's increasingly going to happen is that contracts and signatures and the scripts that are involved in these things and the encumbrances of attaching a public key or signing with a hash of some other data or some other secret or the output of some other program or something into the signature of a transaction. I think those things are going to become so widespread that it's important that we make those as efficient. Private. And capable as possible. Absolutely. And right now, you basically have to tell the Bitcoin chain all of the possible scripts. You have to write this huge tree, and you have to publish this whole tree to the Bitcoin blockchain, which means it costs a fortune. It's a massive data hog. And more importantly, not only is it a data hog that's expensive for the person issuing the transaction, but it's also a huge burden on the computation of validating the chain. Yes. After you get to multi SIG and like Lightning network and all of these transactions. While you're syncing up a node. All the empty blocks up to block 200,000 or something like that go in like an hour. They like it just plows through all of them. And then it starts to slow down for another 200,000 when blocks are kind of full and you're getting full like 1 MB blocks and stuff.

      "text": "is that that is the power that you can do with taproot. So the amount of complexity and branching that you can do within this and the number of different data structures and metadata and time locks and alternatives and various keys that you can do and stack within a single signature is unbounded. You can do it practically indefinitely. And that is a fascinating thing. And we just don't understand all of the things that will be possible to build with that. When you can start to create these sorts of arrangements, you could have a federated set up within a single key. There's a serious potential that you could run side chains like this. And god, it's so crazy. It's so crazy how much this is going to move very quickly. And I think every shit coin that has boasted that, oh, we can run stable coins on top of us, and that was damn near their claim to fame, is going to be in a bad spot. It's going to be in really bad spot because like it or not, it's coming back to bitcoin. Now, the trade offs, what's the danger? What's the risk of having non bitcoin assets issued on bitcoin? This is where things get kind of hairy because it's a bittersweet, right? There's a lot of great things that can happen with this. Credit is not going anywhere. Credit is a critical part of any economy. And to be able to issue credit for a business, or equity for a business, well, I mean, it's a clear use case. It's a clearly valuable thing that an economy needs. And I think it makes sense that we would end up using bitcoin as the consensus model for this, as the double spend protection, like as the time chain. That is what bitcoin does. That is fundamentally the power of this technology. So it makes sense that it ends up there. But when you end up in a contentious situation, when you end up in a block size war, assets that must be scarce necessarily, like equity or whatever, it becomes a risk, it becomes an unknown factor or an increasingly mode of influence over which direction the bitcoin network takes. So during a contentious hard fork, you have a problem. Imagine if coinbase had issued USDC, $100 million, a billion dollars worth of USDC onto the bitcoin chain before the block size war, and then doubled down and said we were only going to support big block bitcoin. Well, when bitcoin forks, those stable coins exist on both chains at the same time, there's, quote, unquote, excuse me, a billion dollars on Coinbase bitcoin. They now have an incredible amount of influence over which network or which fork becomes the quote unquote accepted or dominant one, because they can make a billion dollars worth of value that people within the bitcoin space are holding vanish because they only have a billion dollars if they're one to one. If they're actually fully reserved, which they're coinbase, I wouldn't trust them to do that. But regardless, they're supposed to have a reserve of a billion dollars for a billion dollars in stable coin. If there's now $2 billion in stable coins on two separate forks of the same network, they have to pick which one that billion dollars exists on. So this is a risky trade off. Now, the reason it might not be as much undue influence as it may seem like at first, is that the underlying value and for the same reason that Tether being on Tron is not a risk to bitcoin right now, they could say, oh, we're only going to use Tron. It's like nobody cares, right? The value of bitcoin remains the value of bitcoin. And if we decide which Lightning network is the one we're running nodes for. And we decide and this is actually kind of the beauty of Taro over Omni in the situation of this or in the scenario of this hard fork. This imagined hard fork with Coinbase Coin. Is that I will not keep my node running for a Lightning network on Coinbase bitcoin. Right. Is that my Lightning network is going to have a bunch of nodes and excuse me. It's going to have a bunch of channels and a bunch of liquidity. And I'm going to have multiple things. And I'm going to accept Lightning payments and stuff from other merchants. And I'm going to pay merchants and I'm going to pay people like other peers and all this stuff. But when the network forks, I'm not going to spin up a shit Coin, I'm not going to spin up a Be cash node and run my Lightning network over there. So they will not be able to settle through my node, their Taro stablecoin, their USDC will not longer get the benefit of my liquidity. Whereas on Omni is that if I have a explicitly stable Coin channel, well, then they can just make that channel disappear for me. So my channel just will only exist on one of those coins. Whereas when we're looking at bitcoin as the settlement layer. Well. Then you've still got this user activated Softwork sort of calling their bluff. Where if the Lightning network does not the Lightning network infrastructure does not support their fork. Well. Then it doesn't matter if that billion dollars of stable coin disappears because everybody's just going to dump it for somebody else's stable coin or for bitcoin on the Lightning network. That will actually settle their payment because the Lightning network becomes useless. If all of the nodes running the Lightning settlement layer, running Lightning nodes and opening up and maintaining all these channels ignores their chain. It's not like a set in stone like, oh God, this makes Coinbase just control things. But it is an interesting new dynamic. And this is also not too unlike the scenario where you're paying kind of like the VIP $300 drive chains, which I still go back and forth on. But when you're paying fees to a side block or whatever, is that you're altering the fundamental incentives? Not a lot. But if more people are using the drive chain as opposed to the base layer. And let's say there are 10%. 20% of fees on that side chain and that side chain has huge blocks. Gigabyte blocks. Well. Then the maintainers of that side chain. The quote unquote nodes that do exist on that side chain can essentially reject or lie about what the accurate fee is to any of the Light clients. And in doing so, they can essentially make mining unprofitable for anybody who is not also mining the side chain. So anyway, it's always important to consider the attack vectors, to consider the trade offs and the incentives that come in play with this. But regardless, stablecoins are here. I think stablecoins are a net benefit to the banking system, to a world that needs to transition to Bitcoin. And like I said, I've always liked the idea that we would kind of bifurcate and turn back into a banknote system where credit from banks were priced individually, were priced in isolation of each other, where each bank had their own stable coin. I think that is a far better and easier to keep the incentives right for a banking system than our current one. That's obviously not discounting the fact that systemically everything is still ",

      "text": "b IP nine or Modern Software Activation. How bitcoin could upgrade next tap, a proposed protocol upgrade that would improve bitcoin's privacy and flexibility is in its late stages of development. Bitcoin core contributors agree that the upgrade would benefit Bitcoin, and so far it generally appears to be welcomed by the wider Bitcoin ecosystem as well. It's therefore likely that Tap Root will make its way into a Bitcoin core release, with other bitcoin implementations possibly to follow. But one question remains how should the Bitcoin network itself upgrade? Tap Root is a consensus protocol change, which means that Bitcoin nodes must somehow switch from the old rules to the new rules without splitting the network into factions enforcing different rules. For various reasons, this has in the past sometimes proven to be a challenge. Improved strategies to activate protocol upgrades are now being contemplated. Previous soft forks and BIP nine. The good news is that Tap Root will be a soft fork. This type of upgrade adds or tightens rules, as opposed to a hard fork which removes or loosens rules. The nice thing about adding or tightening rules is that anything that an upgraded node considers valid, a non upgraded node considers valid too. If an old node accepts both transaction types A and B, but new rules only allow transaction type A, the old node would remain compatible on a network enforcing the new rules. Bitcoin's earliest softworks were activated through flag days. Developers, in particular Satoshi Nakamoto, embedded a future date in the code of a new bitcoin software client release, specifying a point in time where upgraded nodes would enforce the new rules. Miners and users were encouraged to upgrade before that date to avoid network splits. As an aside, in those days, miners and users were more often than today the same people, since non upgraded nodes remained compatible with new rules. A handy benefit of softworks is that if a majority of hash power enforces the upgrade, the entire bitcoin network finds consensus on their version of the blockchain. This also means there is less of a pressing need for all nodes to be upgraded immediately when the new protocol rules are enforced, allowing users some flexibility. Though users are encouraged to upgrade, nonetheless, they are ultimately the ones enforcing the new rules by rejecting transactions and blocks that break them. Since about 2012, soft forks have increasingly utilized hash power as a coordination mechanism to coordinate a switch to the new rules. By embedding a bit of data in their blocks, miners can signal to other miners in the rest of the network that they upgraded their software and thus are ready to enforce the new rules once enough hash power signals support, all upgraded nodes are triggered to enforce the new rules. Over the course of a few upgrades, this strategy evolved into bitcoin improvement proposal Nine. BIP Nine was, for example, the mechanism used to activate bitcoin's last soft fork upgrade, Segregated Witness, or SegWit. Miners were given a year to activate the upgrade, requiring 95% of blocks within any difficulty interval to include a readiness signal bit. If after a year this didn't happen, the activation period would expire and the upgrade would have failed. It could then, of course, simply be tried again. For SegWit. However, BIP Nine did not play out smoothly. As with some of the previous upgrades, some miners probably didn't get around to upgrading for some time. Due to apathy, there often isn't a big incentive for miners to upgrade fast. But a bigger problem was that some miners had come to understand the signaling process as a sort of vote on the upgrade, where instead of signaling readiness, they would or would not signal support for it. Worse, some miners ended up using this vote to block the upgrade in order to try and gain political leverage over the bitcoin development process, and or they voted against the upgrade in order to covertly benefit from a quirk in the bitcoin protocol, which the upgrade would fix. After an extended period of intense drama, SegWit ultimately did activate, but only after alternative bitcoin clients included new activation schemes. BIP 148, included in the Bi P 148 client run by some users, was programmed to only accept blocks signaling support for the protocol upgrade starting on a flag day. Meanwhile, VIP 91, included in the BTC One client and run by minors just ahead of the VIP 148, Flag Day effectively lowered the hash power requirement from 95% to 75%. Faced with a potential split network and a possible loss of income, the obstructing miners conceded. But for most Bitcoin core developers, BIP Nine had revealed itself to be a suboptimal solution, and they started thinking of alternatives. ",

Remember, all that a channel is is a set of pre signed transactions to lay the foundation for future privacy improvements. One of those is the shift away from hash time lock contracts to point timelock contracts or PTLCs. Currently, HTLCs are what guarantee that a payment either succeeds or fails for every hop along a payment route, the pre image to the hash lock is released and guarantees the payment goes through for everyone, or it doesn't, and is refunded for everyone. PTLCs accomplish the same thing using adapter signatures instead of hashes, which means that every hop along the path does not have the same hash, which could identify a single payment across multiple hops if one person is running multiple nodes along the payment path. While this by no means is a magic privacy solution for the network, it is a building block toward comprehensive privacy once other solutions are implemented. The next step after implementing tap root channels for Lightning is updating the channels live on the network to use them. There are 82 697 public Lightning channels as of this writing, with close to the most efficient use of blockspace containing around 3300 transactions. That would take 25 blocks of just channel closures to close them all out and another 25 to reopen them as taproot channels. Let's assume that there are twice as many private channels as there are public ones. This would bring the total to around 150 blocks to close out and reopen all existing Lightning channels as tap root channels, assuming the blocks are filled with no other transactions. In reality though, those blocks are not going to be full of just Lightning transactions, so this process could take a week or more for the entire network to cycle through an upgrade. LND is planning to implement a feature called on the Fly Channel Updates, where instead of closing existing channels and opening new ones, you simply spend the existing channel state pre signed transaction into a new one instead of into outputs that would close the channel on the chain. This comes at the cost of an extra transaction for non cooperative closes, but would allow node operators to take advantage of new tap rootbased features without having to close existing channels. Obviously, the implementation of Taro will likely take a front seat at some point after these developments, but the implementation of a brand new top layer token protocol will likely take some significant amount of time. Given other features that might be a good idea to implement, as well as the day to day work of optimizing the nodes existing functionality, I don't think there's any telling how long until that sees the light of day.

But really quick, a huge thank you to my patrons for supporting Bitcoin Audible and Bitcoin magazine and Aaron von Bordeaux for this and all of their brilliant articles, really. And our sponsors, the bitbox two hardware wallet to keep your keys safe in cold storage in a hardware vault. We got Level Co LVL Co mobile banking services that integrate your Fiat and bitcoin banking life. And then, of course, Swan bitcoin for your automatic no hassle bitcoin savings plan. You can find all of these at guyswan with two Ns.com and let them know that you appreciate that they're supporting the podcast and making Bitcoin Audible available. Our bitcoin resource for today is Mempool Space. That's short for memory pool. So mempool. Space. I love this block. Explorer. I go to it all the time to check on fees. I watch for it when it might be a good time to consolidate or need to look up some blocks, or just want to nerd out and dig through the bitcoin time chain. So don't forget to check out Mimpool Space if you don't use it. And also check out yesterday's resource if you're looking for a job in bitcoin. Bitcoinernjobs, go. All right, guys, thank you so much for listening. This is Bitcoin Audible. I am God Swan. And until next time, everybody take it easy. This has been a 111 production and you were listening to Bitcoin Audible on the let's Talk Bitcoin Network. This podcast is a part of the Csuite Radio Network.

I'm going to yeah, I'll post this with a poll on Twitter and just let it run for a week or so and see if there's any relative consensus on Twitter about what the best path might be and leave me a comment or shoot me a damn. Do you think that having a quick way to switch back and forth is a good thing? Does this lead to even more problems? Or an attack vector where a bunch of people can signal lot true and then at last second turn it off or whatever? Should you have to pick which client to download specifically? Lot true or lot false client? Maybe it's a choice that within 2016 blocks of the time out, it's permanent unless you uninstall and reinstall. I don't know, I'm just spitballing here. Let me know your thoughts. Share this out with everyone you know, everyone who runs a node. Take the poll, share that out as well, tag my node umbrella, all the node builders and client devs and anybody you know to see if somebody wants to make a release or propose a client or something like that and get their input on the poll too. I know Twitter isn't the whole bitcoin verse, but it might be a good litmus test for how we should move forward. So we will get to our bitcoin resource of today. But really quick, a huge thank you to my patrons for supporting Bitcoin Audible and Bitcoin magazine and Aaron von Bordeaux for this and all of their brilliant articles, really. And our sponsors, the bitbox two hardware wallet to keep your keys safe in cold storage in a hardware vault. We got Level Co LVL Co mobile banking services that integrate your Fiat and bitcoin banking life. And then, of course, Swan bitcoin for your automatic no hassle bitcoin savings plan. You can find all of these at guyswan with two Ns.com and let them know that you appreciate that they're supporting the podcast and making Bitcoin Audible available. Our bitcoin resource for today is Mempool Space. That's short for memory pool. So mempool. Space. I love this block. Explorer. I go to it all the time to check on fees. I watch for it when it might be a good time to consolidate or need to look up some blocks, or just want to nerd out and dig through the bitcoin time chain. So don't forget to check out Mimpool Space if you don't use it. And also check out yesterday's resource if you're looking for a job in bitcoin. Bitcoinernjobs, go. All right, guys, thank you so much for listening. This is Bitcoin Audible. I am God Swan. And until next time, everybody take it easy. This has been a 111 production and you were listening to Bitcoin Audible on the let's Talk Bitcoin Network. This podcast is a part of the Csuite Radio Network.

This is where it gets interesting. First off, the cooperative close would utilize Schnor's threshold trick to make it look like a regular transaction from one person to another.

And the more complex stuff you do, the bigger and bulkier that data gets. And it can get really obnoxious, really fast. Tap root is a protocol upgrade that turns all of that scripting data even if it has 1000 different branches of failsafes and backups and what if clauses after six months and blah, blah shrinks it all down into a single uniform sized signature. So this not only provides extraordinary data savings for more complex smart contracts, which is pretty relevant right now, with fees being pretty huge. I think the median fee right now is like $16 or something, but it also creates privacy in what the actual contract is doing. So you might have like seven or eight other parties, like your lawyer, a secondary business relationship. The number of things that you could have in a bitcoin contract are basically limitless, but you might not want to broadcast to the whole world that they're even involved. Like you don't want everybody to just be able to see that and all the potential backups and branches and attack vectors of who owns what just by looking at your transaction. And if it's all hidden in a tap root signature, none of it is visible. Even in the case of that complicated Lightning contract, it looks exactly the same as if you were just sending one amount of bitcoin to one person. The signature looks identical. It's a really powerful improvement to bitcoin, and it even has the potential to make it down the road so that you can actually batch with other people. So, yes, we can uniform our signatures down to one basic signature, even with a complex script. But then you could actually take hundreds of different signatures of different parties and compress those already compressed signatures down into just one signature as well. So this could create another multiple when it comes to data efficiency with batching and coin joins and multisig and like a peer to peer batching protocol, like all sorts of things. So there's just an amazing amount of potential with this upgrade. And the second part of the thing I just hit with combining different signatures into one is something that's possible down the road after we have tap root. Tap root makes that available so that's tap root in a nutshell, and we're about to get the first major part of that on the network live. And right now we're basically arguing about how to turn it on. And that's where this is much easier to cover. But that's where the lot equals true versus the lot equals false thing comes in. I've got a link in the show notes for a read where Aaron covers this whole thing and what it all means. But again, this is really simple. Basically, how do we turn this thing on? And what we're trying to do is we're trying to reach a certain number of nodes and miners on the network to update to the new code before we turn it on, because everybody needs to be on the new rules before it's safe to cut them on. So basically, setting this to false means that we're going to try to activate, but if we don't hit a high amount of adoption miners installing the new code, here the amount that we would like, it just runs out, it just expires itself and we start back at the drawing board and we come up with a new plan. Lot equals true means that if we don't hit the adoption threshold, screw it, let's turn it on anyway, which actually puts pressure on everybody to go ahead and adopt it and make sure they have it installed because there is a cost or a risk to not doing so. Whereas in the other situation, somebody could actually support tap root or not really care, but then not upgrade because who cares? Like just to be a new sensor, just because they don't want to do anything. So they could slow everyone down and prevent the tap root upgrade from happening for no other reason than they just didn't want to be bothered. So hopefully that kind of lays the groundwork for now. We're here now we have an argument about whether we want this thing to be true or false. And now there are two separate clients using two separate activation methods. What does that mean?

      "text": "back in the swing of making more targeted direct changes after the 2017 separate, blah, blah. I think the other cool thing right now is one thing that I really like with way style work is, okay, now at this point we know that so many things go well. Basically we can basically start to use tap root in November, October. So I think it's really big for companies, for example, for us. I'm like, okay, well, I can design things today and I can know I can deploy it versus weird uncertainty thing is it going to happen or not? Whatever else. So I really like that pattern. I think initially I was kind of like I didn't really grasp why it was, oh, it's another parameter, more problems type of thing. But then I was like, okay, this is actually really ingenious. Definitely credit to Russell O'Connor. And I basically worked on this thing going forward. So I'm hopeful that this thing will work out. Basically people can see it as a thing going forward. We can basically do this thing. Obviously the UAS and stuff is always in the back pocket. I kind of like nowadays to basically concealed carry. It's like, okay, well I'm walking around, I got like a Deagle right here. You're not going to try me, you know what I mean? You're not going to try to roll up. I don't need to have it pulled out and locked and loaded. These scary people say, okay, it's a concept carry. So it's all about deterrence basically. I think I kind of like these exams we basically have something basically can we reject it can happen faster, not if not this kind of deterrence. So I think we're kind of feeling out exactly how these things happening in practice. I think sometimes people want to kind of have like the perfect way to do it. I don't think that really exists right. Because we're dealing with people with humans basically different intent, things like that as well too. I think good enough just to make sure things are moving forward. That's probably pretty good and then nothing as well. It's probably not going to have every single component that you want, but that's okay as well too, as long as they meets the goal of this moving forward. Maybe you wanted this or that, you wanted a different reputation or whatever else. Those are kind of like triple parameters. I think we make sure we're looking at the big goal basically like why we're all here in the first place and not get caught up in these kind of like this or that type of thing which obviously pop up in software is there all the time because programming is always do a given task, right. And there's no best way. But you can kind of reason about the trade offs one of them. But I think we have a pretty good thing here in St and hopefully we can reuse it again maybe sometime next year or something like that and see how these can go forward. But yeah, because I remember back in the day when I started joining, we kind of had a software every six or so. I'm not saying we need something like that itself, but I think just even like the notion in the investors mind, particularly like the new people, that, okay, well the thing can evolve and move forward. That's a pretty powerful thing. But once again it is a case where you can say how the core value of the coin itself, nothing really needs to change. You can say now basically just work out. But I think we say, okay, well the world's in itself too. Can we start to kind of encompass more and more users basically and then once again uploading those very base pinchles that we know should not change basically. And they kind of underlie what people feel is the value of system itself, because I think we're definitely seeing people wake up more and more because I think it's kind of a thing where it's like something that happened to me as well to remember. Like, I heard about Bitcoin. Okay. Whatever else, that's cool. And then a few years later, I was, oh, it's still there. So I think people are having that kind of like, well, okay, it's still there. A lot of stuff is going on around the world. Maybe I should look into this thing again. And they weren't really crazy. So I think you can see all these kind of old heads, like the OG investors, blah, blah, blah, change their mind, which is obviously a very powerful thing and something that any human being needs to do, kind of like not hold the principles too tightly to basically have new information up there a bunch of miles I'm seeing. I'm okay, this is really good. So definitely one time to be alive and to work on Bitcoin, just being interactive with all this stuff. It's just the craziest massive experiment on even increasingly more global scale now. Right. So now we have people in offices of power, politicians talking about it. They kind of like, actually connect direct change. So I'm definitely really excited to see what's going on in collaborator. There one thing I thought really cool. It just seems like they have more so more kind of technologically literate politicians based in terms of their government, which I think is just so different from the US in that we just feel like we have a bunch of dinosaurs. Right. Remember I saw the presentation at the top of the President. I was like, Yo, he's using a slide deck. Bitcoin 101 lightning. Things like that can bite and even make a PowerPoint. Mention the word lightning network. I don't know, I feel like that just really just charges me up. I was like, damn this, who gets it? This can really be really big for them as well too, in terms of their opportunities. They have possibly as far as increasing stage of the country, more economic opportunities, jobs, things like that as well, too. So you definitely can't downplay it. I thought it was interesting when it first came, people like, oh, it's just Elsa's, right? It's like, oh, come on. Only small companies now it's only a small country, right? Only a small continent is the next one. Yes. They made other countries to be like, oh, that's an option. Like plays a move. You could do that. Well, it's like, yeah, we're kind of rewriting the rules. Right? And that's why I was having so fun. Okay, back to the show after Word for the sponsors. Have you thought about multi signature and upgrading from a single signature set up? Unchained Capital are building Bitcoin native financial services on a foundation of multi signature. So you can create a two of three vault, meaning you might have two hardware wallets as an example, one cold card and one Trezor. And you can create a set up where you hold two keys geographically distributed and Unchained holds the third key as that third signing party if you ever need them. Now, you can set this up for free with no setup or storage if you build it on your own. On the other hand, they've got a concierge service. They'll do calls with you, ship you hardware walls, answer your questions, and deposit $1,000 of Bitcoin in your vault. Use code Levera to get a discount there, and Unchained offer all sorts of other products and services like advanced business accounts. They offer an OTC desk in certain States, as well as lots of free content on their website, such as Parker Lewis's gradually than Suddenly series. Go to Unchained.com to find out more. Clinkeye.com are the creators of my favorite Bitcoin hardware wallet, the cold card. So the cold card is special because you can use it in an air gapped way, meaning you can get an SD card and ferry the transactions back and forth and ferry the XP data between your cold card and your computer wallet like Spectre Desktop or Sparrow or Electrum or others. The cold card is a really advanced piece of technology, and it's there to help you secure your Bitcoins. It can operate as part of a single signature set up or as part of a multi signature set up, so it's really worthwhile looking into. Go to Coinkite.com and use the code Livra to get a discount on your cold card. And finally, Cyphersafe IO producing metal seed backup products. So when you write down those 24 words for your Bitcoin hardware wallet, you need somewhere to put that in a metal product. Now, Cypher Safe have a new one coming out. It's called Cypher Grid. This is the best value in the industry. You get everything you need for $59. It's got two stainless steel plates for all 24 seed words. It's got Privacy by default. It's stainless steel hardware. Holding it together, you can lock it with a padlock. You get a tamper evident seal and an automatic center punch provider, so you can punch in four letters for each word. And just like all Cypher save products, it's made from stainless steel. It's fireproof, rustproof and waterproof. So make sure you or your loved ones can access your Bitcoins. If an accident occurs, go to Cyphersafe IO and use the code Libera to get yours back to the show. Yeah. And going back to your comment earlier, it's very interesting, that idea of ",

      "text": "on. So there is a new proposal called tap root, which I'm sure we'll talk about in another episode. And part of what tap root will do is for every input, you have to sign the amount, not just of that input, but also all the other inputs. And so, yeah, you can't lie about one input but not lie about the other input. I see. And I think it's not just the amount. There's a whole bunch of things you sign in for about that previous transaction, so you really don't have to find it anymore. So with that, you'd sign way more information about this transaction in general. In general, with transaction signing, it's kind of a weird concept because the signature is in the transaction. So how does that work? You can't sign before you have the signature. So what you do before you sign the transaction is where the signature goes. You put a dotted line, so to speak, and you sign everything or you sign some parts of it. You can change that scheme a little bit, add a little bit more to it, or remove things from it. So that's what's happening yeah, but right. Now, I guess we're sort of drifting in a different topic now, but that's fine by me. So right now you indicate which part of the transaction you're going to sign, right? With the SIG hash flag? Yes. So would Tap actually make that less flexible then? No, I think it just changes the meaning. So Segash, all is what most transactions use, which is pretty much signing everything about the transaction. And I think so what Segwood added is you're not just signing the content of your own transaction, you're also signing something about the inputs, namely the amount. And so what TAPRO changes would be to sign not just the amount of the previous transaction, but a bunch of other things. That would be the script. I haven't read it. And what's this done to solve this specific problem, or are there other problems it solves? Maybe. So that comes into why did this thing become an issue again? Because it was known since 2017, and so I'm not sure. This problem was brought up again on the mailing list, and this tap root solution was brought up on the mailing list. And so my theory is that bringing up the solution for Taproot reminded people of the original problem, made other people look at that original problem and not agree that as innocent, they would feel more strongly about it. Yeah, because this issue isn't new in itself. Like you said, it was around for a year. So you think it was just rediscovered? Yeah, it was either rediscovered or it was noticed. Like somebody proposes this solution and you think, hey, what are you actually solving? Oh, I didn't know about that problem. So something like that might have happened. Right. But I'm sure you can look it up in the archives right now. It should be noted that ",

      "text": "What does Tap Root lock in recap a little bit for our listeners that maybe miss previous episodes. What does it mean? That Tapu has locked in. Right. So for every software, there is at least as of the last six, seven years, there is mechanism BIP nine, bib eight. Kind of varies. But the idea is that a software can be in multiple States. It's a state machine. And the first state it would be in is defined and defined just means this software exists, we know about it. Then there's a software state called Start it, and that means that can signal for it. And so that means that when a software gets started, all nodes are paying attention to that signal, and then the. Signal is just a bit of data in the Bitcoin block. In the Bitcoin block, they mine. Yeah. In the header that's just a bit is flagged. So notes, start counting minor signaling. Yeah. And if they're signaling that way before software is in the start state, then that signal is just noise. It's ignored. But there are some nodes might look at that and say, hey, I'm seeing some signaling. I don't understand what this is, and they might want to use it. There might be a software that you don't know about. Anyway, this signaling took place. It crossed a certain threshold, and then it went into the next state, which is called locked in, and it's going to remain in that state until block number 709,632 kwh. Yeah. So we used the speedy trial activation mechanism, which we discussed in the previous episode, which meant that miners had about three months to signal support. And if 90% of minors would signal support within one difficulty period, that means the software would be locked in, which means it would activate later. So that happened last week. Chapel got locked in. And like you said, that means it's going to activate at block 709,632, which is scheduled to be mined in November of this year. No, it's not scheduled, but it's expected to be mined in November this year. Right. The other thing, I guess, is worth noting because we also had the episode about the difference activation mechanism and sort of the alternative clients that did something very similar but slightly different. Without getting into the details of that one, we can just safely say at this point that will also activate Taproot at the same block, presumably in November. Yes. So I would assume that at this point there's no point in running that alternative client anymore. Yeah, I tend to agree with that. At this point, it's probably better to just run Bitcoin Core Zero point 21.1 or any newer Bitcoin Core leads that's upcoming. Yes, exactly. And that's basically for those that don't know that because I've seen some questions about that, people asking how to prepare for temporary or how to get ready. That's basically as simple as it is. Upgrades to Bitcoin Core Zero point 21.1 or a newer version of Bitcoin Core or potentially if that's what you're into some alternative client or implementation that also enforces that route. But I don't know which ones these. Yeah, I think at the moment, Nondo. I know that activation client then. Yeah, exactly. So I think Lip, Bitcoin and BTCD are working on Tap root, but they haven't done it yet. So you can't run their code yet to check for Tap root rules. So this is basically just upgrade to Bitcoin Core Zero point 21.1, I guess is our. Exactly. And if you really want to use the cool features that are going to be in Taproot, like Wallet support, we'll get to that later. But then you're going to need Bitcoin version, Bitcoincore version 22, which will come out later. But you don't have to do that. I think I can just finish the list of States because we were talking about it. So it starts with defined, then it's started, then it's locked in, which is where we're now, then it becomes active and active just means what you think it means. The rules apply and that's what's going to happen. And it's going to stay there forever. Well, at some point, a new version might be released that just assumes it's active and doesn't explicitly say it anymore. It could have also reached the state failed. Right. But it didn't. It didn't.

      "text": "I think really the big benefit to tap it, I don't think there's any even a specific proposal. It's just that everything that we're doing now can be made more efficient, like multi SIG. Right now, multi SIG is, like, a huge burden, but it's kind of becoming the standard. Like, I don't like to have anything, any large amount that's not behind multi stick. I don't even like the idea of relying on one hardware wallet anymore for my security, particularly with the ledger privacy dump. And I've got this new one. Kobo vault. I'm not sure if you've played with that one yet, but it's really cool looking. But I'm 100% sure if I trust it, like, they're a new company. I don't know of anybody who has reviewed the firmware and stuff in these things. Like, it could be a honey pot. They could be trying to steal a bunch of people's bitcoin, but it's okay to use it in, like, a multi SIG. I don't have to trust that hardware while I'm splitting up that trust among multiple. If I do a two of three multi SIG, and that's getting easier. You got a casa, you got, like, blockstream green, you've got a caravan, and all these things that are making this much easier to basically sign with multiple keys, just kind of swap the suckers in and out and hit, approve, hit, approve, approve, and you've got a signature. And because of that, the new security standard is a giant bloat on the chain. And of course, obviously it's a privacy giveaway that you have a multi SIG. Tap root natively has threshold signatures, which are basically the same thing just done with shore signatures and kind of a different mechanism. But it's multi sigma SIG with one signature. And again, all of the tracking of multi SIG outputs and stuff on the chain you're getting to see is like, oh, look, all these people are here's. All the multi sigs that are related to lightning. Here are all the multi sigs that appear to be somebody's savings account, and maybe even they can connect it to, like, services can easily connect it to you. No, shut up. Alarm. Okay? But a tap root just hides all of this. I want people to see as little data as possible when they're looking at the blockchain, even though the efficiency is great, it really is. And particularly, like, in validation and stuff because someone who. Someone is talking to someone out the window. I think we've got a delivery here. Hold on a second. This is organic security meat space security. I got to get my gun just in case it's not security. Alarm. False alarm. Nobody's here to murder me. Take all your bitcoin. Which they couldn't. I was deleting. I had my hammer out, ready to. Destroy my transit distributed multi SIG, right? Yeah, do it. I was saying on Twitter, you got to have signs. Like you have security signs out there. Like this house protected by ADC or whatever the security company is called. The one out there says, protected by distributed multi SIG. Somebody comes up to your house for the $5 inch tag and you're like, move on to the next bitcoin. And this guy's got multisick. I don't really feel like kidnapping him and dragging him around to various locations. Oh, Jesus. So that's why it's important guys get on the multi SIG before this thing moons. This thing goes to 200, 300K. Like you're going to make sure and. A little bit of money in bitcoin can turn into a lot of money so quickly when things get out of control, it becomes completely apparent, freakishly apparent, how not good your security is when you had an account that was like, maybe it's only $1,000 or whatever, and then suddenly it's like, eleven grand. Like, who, okay. And you got a hurricane on that out in the water or whatever right now out in the Atlantic. And you're like, holy crap, if this floods, I think I would lose all of it right now. I don't have a proper backup. I don't have another key in another place. And it just feels really good when you really focus and get your stuff behind multiple keys and you know you're protected in a way that if my house burned down right now or if I was kidnapped, like, I have just enough of a key, but not enough of a key that I could always get it back with time and going to another location. But I wouldn't lose it. But neither would I be able to give it to someone else. You know what I mean? Like, I could be kidnapped and I would just be like, you would have to shoot me. I would be like, I can read you the seed of one of my multi six, but all I have is that I have the one key of my multi SIG. I can't give you my bitcoin, and it's like, you're just going to have to shoot me. You're going to have to take me to the bank and the thing, you take me to the other location, just like you're saying. And it's comforting even though it probably means they're going to shoot me. Right? No point, unless they're just a psychopathic murderer. Most people are just in it for the money. There's some major consequences just to murdering people. Most people aren't ready for that. And that one, like I said, it's hard to get away with murder. It will stay that way, especially in an age of decreasing privacy. Yeah. That'S kind of that horrible trade off of privacy. Like, you won't want bad guys to get caught, but you don't want that. Trade off does exist, but obviously I think without a doubt, the benefits of privacy, I think the idea of independence and privacy actually discourages the mentality that creates criminality and murders and stuff like the sound money and personal responsibility. I think so much of the mentality that leads to criminality and stuff is that I'm entitled to your stuff, is that I'm hopeless and I'm not even in control of my own life. Like, so much of it is an attempt to control something when you feel like you have no control. Sound money or I guess poisonous money. Controlled and corrupted money is such a source of that sort of thing spreading throughout society. And you actually kind of see that when you get to these times. When society is bloated and full of debt and all of these things are going awry. You get exactly a huge explosion in that sort of mentality in criminal behavior and violent behavior and all of this stuff. So I think you can't really separate those two. Even though in the short term it appears that privacy and independence and the ability to be anonymous or whatever, all of those things may benefit criminality in the short term, I think in the long term it kind of gets at the root of what causes criminality. Yeah, there was an era before crimefighting relied on killing your privacy. Good old fashioned police work can happen again. Right? And even with Tatrooo, the blockchain is still monitorable and still pseudonymous. It's going to hide the details of contracts and et cetera, which is good, but it's not going to hide identities necessarily. And even if the Lightning network is dark, it's still going to be hard to route massive amounts of money over it. So if you're going to be doing some engaging in some huge international arms deal or something like that, you're not going to be doing it on Lightning. Yeah, it's a whole lot better for them to use the banking system and Deutsche Bank right now to get that done, of course. But there's something really interesting, actually, it's kind of a little bit going too far down this topic, but I think it's in the crypto anarchist manifesto. I don't know if it's the Crypto anarchist or the Cypherpunk manifesto. One of the manifesto talks about how an anonymous system is not a secret system, and it's about allowing the parties involved to disclose explicitly what they want to disclose to the world, what they want the public to know, but that they simply have the option of remaining private. Whereas a secret system is one where nobody knows where you're doing something that you think is wrong or bad and you don't want anyone to know. It like it's your privilege, it's your access. But that's kind of the fascinating thing about something like Lightning is that the transactions are private between you and who you're transacting with. So the old fashioned police work will be going to the person you got a transaction with. And if it was indeed one to hurt somebody or do something terrible or evil or human trafficking or something like that. Yeah, it's the same as transmitting a big old bag of cash to the person who you're hiring to murder somebody. Exactly. But the real world associations between the two parties are going to be there. Yeah, back ",

I think so much of the mentality that leads to criminality and stuff is that I'm entitled to your stuff, is that I'm hopeless and I'm not even in control of my own life. Like, so much of it is an attempt to control something when you feel like you have no control. Sound money or I guess poisonous money. Controlled and corrupted money is such a source of that sort of thing spreading throughout society. And you actually kind of see that when you get to these times. When society is bloated and full of debt and all of these things are going awry. You get exactly a huge explosion in that sort of mentality in criminal behavior and violent behavior and all of this stuff. So I think you can't really separate those two. Even though in the short term it appears that privacy and independence and the ability to be anonymous or whatever, all of those things may benefit criminality in the short term, I think in the long term it kind of gets at the root of what causes criminality. Yeah, there was an era before crimefighting relied on killing your privacy. Good old fashioned police work can happen again. Right? And even with Tatrooo, the blockchain is still monitorable and still pseudonymous. It's going to hide the details of contracts and et cetera, which is good, but it's not going to hide identities necessarily. And even if the Lightning network is dark, it's still going to be hard to route massive amounts of money over it. So if you're going to be doing some engaging in some huge international arms deal or something like that, you're not going to be doing it on Lightning. Yeah, it's a whole lot better for them to use the banking system and Deutsche Bank right now to get that done, of course. But there's something really interesting, actually, it's kind of a little bit going too far down this topic, but I think it's in the crypto anarchist manifesto. I don't know if it's the Crypto anarchist or the Cypherpunk manifesto. One of the manifesto talks about how an anonymous system is not a secret system, and it's about allowing the parties involved to disclose explicitly what they want to disclose to the world, what they want the public to know, but that they simply have the option of remaining private. Whereas a secret system is one where nobody knows where you're doing something that you think is wrong or bad and you don't want anyone to know. It like it's your privilege, it's your access. But that's kind of the fascinating thing about something like Lightning is that the transactions are private between you and who you're transacting with. So the old fashioned police work will be going to the person you got a transaction with. And if it was indeed one to hurt somebody or do something terrible or evil or human trafficking or something like that. Yeah, it's the same as transmitting a big old bag of cash to the person who you're hiring to murder somebody. Exactly. But the real world associations between the two parties are going to be there. Yeah, back ",

These things are like indistinguishable from normal activity on Bitcoin, and they do very general things. And on top of that, as we mentioned, with integrating them with Lightning, I like to think of DLCs as something more like a building block. You can use this with other protocols. It's a way of making payments contingent on things Oracle say. So that's just like add that into your toolbox that already has multifig and time locks and hash locks and point locks. Now you have Oracle locks as well, and you just throw that into your toolkit and move on and build stuff on top of that as well. That is awesome. So I've recently had a few people I know personally who invested in bitcoin just before this major run up, and they've really been riding a rocket down the rabbit hole. So I was just having a combo with somebody who was just like, I need to run a note. I got to get on Lightning. Do I need a raspberry pi computer? What? Hardware wallet, all this crazy stuff. And I'm like, slow down. The first and most important thing you need to do is secure your savings by holding your keys. You need a secure, easy to use hardware wallet. That is the bitbox. Two. It is actually cofounded by a Bitcoin developer, and the team is made up of serious engineers. It is Swiss made. It's a sleek, simple design. The backup is as simple as plug in your SD card, hit the backup button, take it out. The wallet software is super minimal, and it just works. If you have started investing, get a bit box before it turns into a ton of money, and keep your bitcoin safe. Check it out at Guy swan combatbox. And you all have basically done this. We merged multi Oracle support in yesterday, so now we've got kind of the full feature set, more or less. Oh, wow. So this is basically ready to go. Well, give me a month or two to test it and document it and get the other implementations up to speed and maybe clean up some of the specifications with more examples and stuff. But yeah, at the end of the day, if you really wanted to and you were savvy enough, you could pull down my code and run it and do because we're doing this on main chain. We do an experiment at this point at least once a month, sometimes once a week. We're like, new kind of contract, let's go. And then we just do it on chain internally. Insured bits. You did a contract for difference on main chain a couple of weeks ago. And before that, me and Chris executed a volatility contract on main chain and all these kinds of things. And every time we get a new bit of features, we're like, okay, let's go, main chain right away. And then coming up, hopefully me and Ben will be executing a multi Oracle CFD change. So that will be the next one thing we do, and that should be soonish. What do you think the first application is for this? Do you all plan on running or being an Oracle or something to start off with? Actually, there already have been DLCs out in the wild. So there's a company called Atomic Finance, and they had an application that ran a market for DLCs on the US election. And this was ongoing for quite a while. And they had a nice website. I think that they got a bunch of the big people on Twitter, like Pierre Shard, and all these other people to come and just put things on the book, essentially like, here are the odds, here's the amount. And then anyone could take. And then it was just kind of like this lightweight browser wallet, web wallet that you would put funds into. It was noncustodial, which is great, but it was like you had to move funds into this web wallet, which in the future won't be the case, hopefully. But regardless, it had this nice interface and it was very smooth. We used it, we played around with it as well. Yeah. And then all of those, I assume, in the coming days are going to be executed and those are all just on chain DLCs that actually happened. So this is like some stuff has already been built with it because on the specification side, so I should say there is a big spectrum effort for DLCs. I lead kind of these monthly meetings with a bunch of people all over the world. We've got people from Crypto Garage over in Japan. We've got Lloyd Fornier, who is out of Australia, and he I believe is funded by Square Crypto and he's just kind of an independent developer working on a bunch of stuff, DLC's being one of them. He's the one actually who figured out how to do these Verifiably encrypted signatures using ECDSA. Everyone knew how to do it with Snore already. These are also called adapter signatures, if you've ever heard of these. Adapter signatures are just these Verifiably encrypted signatures. Yeah. And so he's writing a specification right now for adapter signatures on ECDSA, which DLCs are using. Anyway, there's a big spec effort. I can share the link for the repo if you want to throw that in the show notes. Yeah, actually that would be great for the show notes. Yeah. And a bunch of activity. Yeah. Essentially right now things are nearing stable but not quite there. And so part of the reason that you haven't seen as much out in the wild is because things on the Oracle side of things are going to be pretty completely stable in a month or two and we're going to be tagging like a V zero or something like this. And then once that's done, Oracles can publish saying, I'm going to say with the bitcoin prices in ten years on this day, or something like that. And we don't want people doing that before we have a completely stable Oracle interface because it's a huge pain if you have open events that haven't been signed yet to do this migration, it's possible it's just a pain. So we want to save people from that. That's part of the reason why the selection that was such a great use case for the time is because it ended very quickly. It used to kind of an old version of DLCs, but it still worked. And the newer version is better and more stuff to come, I'm sure, from the guys over atomic finance. Questions on DLC Lightning real quick. Yeah. Is that when you're doing that, like, let's say it's like a month before the election and I write this transaction, does that then mean that I'm basically like, let's say my route to you is through Bob. Does that mean that we're locking up money with Bob for that month and I'm essentially paying for one of the whole HTLCs or whatever that will let him pay him an interest rate essentially for holding that money? Yeah. So there's ",

The minor issues around like, oh, it takes one more bit to do this, have all been sorted and in fact aren't even necessary. It seems like this is all around nothing but positives for Bitcoin. So we could get activation once we have an activation method, which again, I think is going to be a VIP eight activation. At least that's what I'm hoping for. And that's kind of what it seems like so far, is that it's just going to be you download this and install it and you're signaling for it and boom, it activates after this span of time. But I think we'll get activation pretty quick. Even though the network is a lot more decentralized and we have a lot of miners involved in this, it's up to us to get the word out, hashtag Taproo 2020 and share it out and make sure everybody, you know, who is mining every mining pool, get them on board with this. This doesn't mean they have to use Tap root when this does finally land in a client. It just means that they need to download and enforce it for other people who choose to use it. Again, this is a backwards compatible upgrade to the network. Nobody is forced to use it if they're worried about the risk or anything like that. It's just that everybody needs to know that it needs to be running all of the same validation rules. So hopefully fingers crossed, blessed be Satoshi, that we get this sooner rather than later. And it's just really exciting to see this merged into the code and take another huge leap toward the final activation and a release of this on the Bitcoin system. So hopefully we covered everything I wanted to talk about. I think I hit all this stuff but just tap roots are really cool and if you want to dig a lot deeper into this, we have many, many episodes that we've talked about tap root in depth. Great piece from Bitcoin magazine, Aaron Van Wardom that just digs all into tap root and what it is and all that sort of stuff. So if you want to go a little bit further, definitely recommend going back and listening to some of those episodes and or reading those pieces. But for now we will close out this guide take episode another. Thank you to Hexa Wallet for sponsoring the show and to everyone in my crew. We got a new crew member just today and it's always exciting and I love it when new people are supporting the podcast. Thank you so much. If you want to be a part of the crew, let me know. All you have to do is give a donation or become a patron on Patreon. Comthecryptonomy is the name it is under and if you want to do that, you'll shoot me a DM, I'll get you a link and get you in the crew. All we do is we hang out and we talk shit and we talk about Bitcoin and it's also a really great resource for asking questions. Everybody's so knowledgeable in there. So if you want to join in, all it takes is as little as a dollar. We'll get you in the group. I just want to save it for specifically supporters of the show. And of course if you want me to be a contact on your Hexa Wallet or be a part of your backup, feel free to message me. I have done it now for numerous people and happy to answer any questions. It's just a cool wallet with a lot of features and of course they are supporting the show as well. So much love to those guys with that. Let's go ahead and close this one out. Thank you so much for listening to Bitcoin Audible. Tap root is on the horizon. I'm so excited. I took my shot in celebration and I can't wait for the next steps of this and you will hear all about it right here on Bitcoin article. I am Guy Swan and until next time, everybody say it easy guys.

At the time of publication of this article, the only other mining pool that responded was Slushpool, whose cofounder Jan Capek said we'll support tap root and doesn't expect it to be as heated a topic as SegWit. CAPEC indicated a preference for BIP eight as the activation method with a 90% hash power activation threshold and forced activation after one year. Over the next days and weeks, Delatore will also be reaching out to bitcoin mining pools to poll where they stand on tap root and the different activation mechanisms and will update the website accordingly. And that closes out the pool and launches initiative to activate taproot by Aaron Vanwerdom and BitcoinMagazine.com. Now, you guys really need to be checking up on Bitcoin Magazine because they literally keep up to date on everything. Like, they're a massive resource for me and I legit just don't have the time to go into every single thing that they write. So just throwing it out there if you want to stay up on a lot of this stuff. My two favorite sources are Bitcoin Optic and Bitcoin magazine. Bitcoin Optic really dives into some of the specifics of this stuff and Bitcoin Magazine is just probably one of the best news sources in the space, to be perfectly honest. So that's just a little shell for Bitcoin Magazine there. But this initiative by Pooling is actually like, this is a big deal in my opinion, because this is a lot of what the developers have been really reluctant about, about just kind of coming out because it is such a central point of failure and they don't want to give the impression that we're just waiting for them to decide. I've been reading in a lot of the discussions and stuff, like I try to at least get in the groups and try to keep up to date and see how they're talking about it. And a lot of people are very reluctant, or a lot of developers are very reluctant about being like, we're going to say it's this way and this is how it needs to be done. There's a lot of power and responsibility that comes with that and more importantly, a very serious central vulnerability if we basically make the precedent that the developers are just deciding how this thing goes and everyone needs to upgrade accordingly. I mean, obviously they cannot force anybody to install the new software, but technically neither can Ethereum. But essentially they have a community that just does whatever the developers say and they don't really put any input in this most recent hard fork, which by the way, there's actually another episode of Shit Coin Insider coming right around the corner where we dig all into this. It was just a complete mess and I really can't believe the dismissive attitude that the developers took around this problem, but it's just basically another great example of the completely polar opposite attitudes of the development community around bitcoin versus that around ethereum. And, well, all coins in general really just picking on ethereum because of their recent debacle. But it's really cool that pool in particular is taking the initiative and really moving ahead and pushing to get people to make a stance on this. And the mining ",

So me, you, Cory, Jan, we could all have a transaction where we are batching together and usually we would have to sign every single UTXO. Well, we can sign and add all of our signatures together literally like a linear, like an algebraic just adding them together and then sit that one signature, that one block of information with all of our UTXOs. And not only does it mean that nobody can tell who owns which one, there's no explicit signature for these four, one signature for these two, blah, blah, blah. There's none of those connections but there's only one piece of data. There's 1200 bits, whatever the size is signature block for all of the UTXOs and this can go to thousands and thousands of them and that is huge. And obviously without Snoring, taproot not even possible. This is step one to get in there and then the other one is L Two, the improvement to Lightning network that will hugely simplify the process of updating channels. In fact, there is one, I haven't read it yet, but somebody was talking about the process of moving funds into and out of a Lightning channel. Man, I know I have that saved in my list somewhere. I probably need to do a guy's take on this because this one was already blowing my mind, but I think I had something to do. I think it was something that was enabled by l Two, but it was basically like on the fly.

That makes routing just so much better. Right? Basically solves any routing issues. Yeah, it's almost like is it like an automatic pull kind of situation from obviously bitcoin is pushed, but where does it get the liquidity? I guess from a different UTXO. Okay, it's wrapping in a different UTXO which is not any different from Splicing or anything, it's just that rather than closing and reopening the channel, you're just rewriting the current one with the new UTXO in it and boom, you've got that liquidity. So do you have to create a channel with like a list of UTXOs that are available to splice in or something like that. I don't know. I don't know that deep yet, but I'm going into it because I just saved it as guy definitely read into and watch this, preferably before you go on citizen bitcoin so you could talk about it. Yeah, well, I gave you two days heads up. So hey, it's not your fault, man. All right, so tap root, man. We got to get tap root in there sooner than later. Of course, it's been on a bit for quite a while and of course the devs are extremely conservative and responsible, pushing out even soft forks, which appropriately but it's getting pretty mature, I feel, at this point.

And that concludes Erin Vanvertim's Tap Root article on Bitcoin magazine. Let's go ahead and hit our sponsor and I really want to dive into this one. All right. Thank you to Bitcoin Magazine for allowing me to continue to read these articles. There's so much great stuff. And another huge thank you to Aaron Vanveredom for the continuous amazing work that he puts out. They are unbelievably lucky to have him as well as I am. We have had him on the show in the past. If you haven't actually listened to that interview, we go into a lot of great stuff and he has so many he's just an ocean of articles to dig through. And I've been consistently told that his Lightning Network series that I read on the show way back when in episode 40 something, is one of the best explanations. And dives into the Lightning Network that you can get. And it's pretty damn thorough and amazing. So I highly recommend all of that stuff. I'll have those links in the show notes along with the Bitcoin Magazine article. But let's talk about tap root. So this piece goes through. There's a lot of people working on these Snore and Tap Root proposals right now, and it's kind of funny that all these things were slowly piled on top of each other and kind of doing the work on all of these softwares. We've got multiple layers of additional use of this technology because Mast is a huge improvement in and of itself. So let's go back to the beginning. I'm going to kind of re explain, hopefully more simply, some of these things. I know, particularly in audio. Hearing all of these terms can make it really confusing to follow. But P two Sh paid to script hash. It just means that you are paying to hash just a fingerprint of some other data that is required to unlock it and that includes a signature and a script typically well, the script is almost always just this person must sign but it can include any amount of complexity that you want. But because you have to reveal all of the script to unlock those coins because what happens is that when I send the coins to their new location they just go and they're locked with the hash. They're locked with the fingerprint of a lot of data and then in order to then unlock that hash. You have to present all of the data that it is the fingerprint of. So it's a cost savings when locking up the coins but it's not a cost savings at all when you unlock the coins because it just changes when you have to broadcast that information to the network because before it was the person who sent the coins was needed in order to or was needing to put all of the different instructions on chain as to how to unlock them. And now it's the person who unlocks the coins that has to give all that information. Which actually makes sense when you think about it because the person getting the security of that complex script who's reaping the benefits of it or utilizing whatever service or smart contract inside of it is the person redeeming it, not the person that's creating it. So it makes sense that we would want the cost on that side of the equation, the receiver rather than the sender. So just in a normal like sorting out the economics of it, that's actually kind of important in my opinion. But again, it doesn't really do anything for privacy or just cost effectiveness overall, just kind of putting the cost for the cost should be that was implemented in 2012 ish, and I can't remember exactly when, but then Mast is a new proposal that is not implemented yet.

A proposed bitcoin protocol upgrade for compact and privacy preserving smart contracts has been included in the most recent version of bitcoin core, currently the de facto reference implementation for the bitcoin protocol. The only remaining step is for the upgrade to activate on the bitcoin network. But as a consensus system without central authority, bitcoin protocol upgrades can be challenging. If one segment of the network upgrades to a new version of the protocol before another segment does, different nodes might enforce different rules, introducing the risk that the network fractures between them a soft fork upgrade, which Tap Root is is backwards compatible. To minimize this risk, as long as a majority of miners by hash power enforce the new rules, both upgraded and nono upgraded nodes accept their version of the blockchain. Upgraded nodes because the new rules are properly enforced, and nonupgraded nodes because none of the legacy rules are being broken. Several of Bitcoin's previous softworks have therefore been deployed by leveraging hash power as a coordination mechanism, which is referred to as a minor activated soft fork or MASF. Once, usually 95% of newly mined blocks included a bit that signaled readiness. All upgraded nodes would start enforcing the new rules. If this threshold wouldn't be met within usually a year, the upgrade would instead expire. In 2017, the segregated witness, or SegWit MASF minor activated soft fork got close to expiring. In the midst of a heated scaling debate, miners refused to signal readiness for the upgrade. In response, a grassroots group of users and some developers released a special Bitcoin software client, the BIP 148 client. The BP 148 client would activate SegWit on a given date, even if there was insufficient hash power support to meet the original 95% threshold, an upgrade mechanism referred to as a user activated software, or UASF. Right before the SegWit UASF would activate, miners started signaling readiness. Now, about four years later, the events around SegWit activation have spurred a new discussion on soft fork activation in the context of the Tap Root upgrade. This discussion is in a small part about the hash power threshold and duration of the activation period, but these seem to have mostly settled on 90% and one year, respectively, which the remainder of this article will also assume.

      "text": "it to you. Thoughts on guys topic on lightning, on things being built during the bear. What are your feelings? Well, I love it. I mean, it's so exciting to see the building on Lightning. I mean, it's just really cool. And you illustrated it perfectly. You don't need a lot of these other coins for this kind of stuff. The foundation of bitcoin is so strong, and I think it's the ultimate cipher punk project and these ideals of decentralization and not having anybody in charge. There's so many revolutionary things about bitcoin that just change everything in how our world works. So it's inevitable that it's going to replace money and then a lot of things that go with money, like Swift. Swift is not exactly money. It's just a clunky, stupid thing that they didn't have anything better to do to move money around. And it's gone. I mean, it's toast. I knew that before the Lightning Network, before it was even invented, it was just as clear as day that there's just no way. And there's a lot of things like that in our world that it's just inevitable to be replaced. So I think it's just a super exciting time to be alive and it's really cool to be in this space. Yeah, it's staggering. Some of the things that have been done and the bear markets are when the greatest innovation comes, right, everybody is asleep. The people that were outside of the space have no idea what's going on. As bitcoin is, you get to be around, experience it, see it happening, see the world at large, not have a clue what's going on. And then the next Bull Run comes, the next hype cycle comes, and everybody's like, the new narrative is like, oh, this is here, this works. And so it was interesting this time around because, like, 2017, the number one concern was scaling. And it's funny because there was still a remnant of that, this Bull Run. There's still, like, the remnants of people being like, oh, well, bitcoin can't scale. You're like, dude, I'm receiving microtransactions from my podcast. What are you talking about? And so it's going to take time to shift. I have no doubt that next Bull Run, if somebody says something like, bitcoin doesn't scale, people will laugh them out of the room because it will be just so blatantly obvious. I think the next turnaround is going to be bitcoin privacy. And I'm very excited on that front in that. In 2017, when it hit a fever pitch, especially early 2017, we had no scaling on bitcoin. There was nothing on chain to make things more efficient. There was no layer two to make things more efficient. Fast forward five years. We've got segued on chain, we've got Taproot on chain, and we've got the Lightning Network, which potentially scales to millions of transactions per second. And that just wasn't even possible at that point in time. And we had no tools from then compared to now. Compare that to privacy. Privacy, I think, is front of mind for a lot of people. A lot of. People are worried that bitcoin privacy is very bad and on chain, more or less, it kind of is. But we do have privacy related tools for bitcoin, a large plethora of them actually, right now. And if that's front of mind, think of the progress that will be made in the subsequent three, four or five years, we'll be in an entirely different place in that period of time. And you'll still have remnants of people being like, you can't be private on bitcoin, but they'll be still moderately mistaken at that point. And then moving forward, they'll be laughably mistaken. So I think it's just whatever the concern is, it ends up being built in some way, shape, or form, and we're already seeing it. And I think moving forward, bitcoin is going to make leaps and bounds in the privacy realm during this bear market. That's my hope, and I hope to see it materialize. And I think it is. It's already there and we're already in a better place versus scaling than we were in 2017. So we'll see how that progresses. But I'll open it up to everybody. I think what I'll start to do is I'm going to start to round it out. But on that topic, if you have any final thoughts or any final thoughts on anything that was mentioned throughout the show, and then I'm also going to give you a challenge as well. We mentioned some resources, so I'm going to throw them out right now. You can't double dip my friends, but if you want to recommend a resource that has been helpful in your bitcoin journey, whether it be a book, an article, a podcast, a video, anything, whatever it may be. The ones that were mentioned were the fourth turning from Bruce when money dies. Both of these definitely worth reading. I have another recommendation I'm not going to mention until the end because I don't want to screw over too many people on their recommendations. If it doesn't get brought up, we'll bring it up again. But The Fourth Turning by William Strauss and Neil Howe and When Money Dies by Adam Ferguson. The first turning is in regards to kind of the cyclical nature of humanity, how we respond to stimuli and crises and so on and so forth, and how we shape our society. When Money Dies basically goes through the conditions that led to and the results of the hyperinflation in Weimar Germany in the 19th, believe, and then which more or less resulted in the Second World War by the end of all of that, or at least in part. So I'm going to jump to Len first, dude. Any final thoughts on anything mentioned throughout the episode and any recommendations for content? So, ",

      "text": "I love to see the innovation that comes out of the bear markets because nobody's going to think and this is what I love about the bear markets, too. Think of how freaked out everybody is about privacy right now, myself included. But you got to think, back in 2017, all of the stuff around scaling was reaching a fever pitch. Like, holy shit, how are we going to scale bitcoin? Everything? And the big narrative was, oh, we got to make a million shit coins. We got a fork bitcoin, we got to change it. We had no scaling whatsoever up until around the summer or the fall of 2017. Segue, it wasn't even enacted for on chain scaling. Now look what we've got. We've scaled on chain. We've added segway, we've added Tapper, which will also help a little bit with scaling. We've also added the Lightning Network, which I use literally daily now. I can now receive fractions of a penny minute by minute for people listening to this podcast. There may be somebody listening to it right now, streaming stats to me hitting that boost button as I say it, and just doing little bursts of SATS. So the scaling in bitcoin went from no solutions available on chain at all whatsoever, to where we are now, which is like, we have massively scaled in a short period of time.

Gentlemen, I'm sorry I don't get to talk to you all the time, but I think you guys are all incredible.

Think of how freaked out everybody is about privacy right now, myself included. But you got to think, back in 2017, all of the stuff around scaling was reaching a fever pitch. Like, holy shit, how are we going to scale bitcoin? Everything? And the big narrative was, oh, we got to make a million shit coins. We got a fork bitcoin, we got to change it. We had no scaling whatsoever up until around the summer or the fall of 2017. Segue, it wasn't even enacted for on chain scaling. Now look what we've got. We've scaled on chain. We've added segway, we've added Tapper, which will also help a little bit with scaling. We've also added the Lightning Network, which I use literally daily now. I can now receive fractions of a penny minute by minute for people listening to this podcast. There may be somebody listening to it right now, streaming stats to me hitting that boost button as I say it, and just doing little bursts of SATS. So the scaling in bitcoin went from no solutions available on chain at all whatsoever, to where we are now, which is like, we have massively scaled in a short period of time.

This would resemble how SegWit was activated, with a Bi P 148 client serving as the equivalent of a Lot True client. This would, however, open the door to some of the coinsplit risks described in this article. It's ",

      "text": "the nice thing is? Tell me, what the risk car stuff. During the secret tox debacle, as well as the USF debacle, which were similar in a way, but also very different because of who was doing this plate and whether it was a hard fork or Softwork. Okay, so let's say you are running the current version of Bitcoin Core. Now let's start easier. Let's say you're running the latest two version of Bitcoin Core. You downloaded it and maybe it was released by Bitcoin Core. Maybe you self compiled it, but it says a lot is true. You want Taproot to activate. But the scenario here we're taking is that the rest of the world, the miners, aren't really doing this. And the day arrives and you see a block and it's not signaling correctly, but you want it to signal correctly. So you say this block is now Invalid. I'm not going to accept this block, and I'm just going to wait until another minor comes with a block that does meet my criteria. And maybe that happens once in every ten blocks, for example. So you are seeing new blocks, but they're coming in very, very slowly. Okay, so somebody sends you a transaction, you want Bitcoin from somebody, they send you a transaction and this transaction has a fee and it's probably going to be wrong. So let's say you're receiving a transaction from somebody who is running a node with Lotus. False. So they're on a chain that is going ten times faster than you are. Right. This is intermediate state. Their blocks might be just full, so their fees are pretty low and you're receiving it. But you're on this shorter, slower moving chain. So your mentor is really full and your blocks are completely full. So that transaction probably won't confirm on your site. It's just going to be sitting in the Mempool one complexity. And that's actually a relatively good scenario because you don't accept unconfirmed transactions. Yeah. So you'll have a disagreement with your counterparty. You'll say, hey, it hasn't confirmed, and they'll say it has confirmed. Then at least you might realize what's going on. You read about the Lot War or whatever. So that's one scenario. The other scenario is where somehow it does confirm on your side and it also confirms on the other side. So that's kind of good, because then you're safe either way. Right? If it's confirmed on both sides and whatever happens in the future, reorg that transaction is actually on the chain, just maybe in a different block. Another scenario could be because these blocks are these chains. There's two chains, one short chain, one long chain, but they're different. And so if you're receiving coins that are from the Coinbase that descends from a coin based transaction on one side or the other, then there's no way it can be valid on your side. Yeah. And this can also be a feature that's called replay protection, essentially. So you receive a transaction and you just don't even see it in your Menpo and you call the other person and say, this doesn't make any sense. So that's good. Okay. But now suddenly the world changes its mind and says, no, we do want tap root. We do want Lotus. True. We are now loddestrued diehards and all the miners start mining on top of your shorter chain and your short chain becomes the very long chain. So in that case, you're pretty happy in most of the scenarios we discussed, right? The transaction sounds good to me, right? You had a transaction that was in maybe your 10th block, and on the outside it wasn't the first lock, but it's still yours. There were some transactions floating in the Mempool for a very long time that finally confirmed. I think you're fairly happy, but I wonder if I was doing it right. Yeah. So we were talking about the latest True Note, right. As a lot of true Note user. Sounds like in these scenarios, you're happy. Yes. Maybe not if you're paying someone. But anyway, you're starting to make the case for Love is true. Sure. I know that's not your intention, but you're doing a good job at it. For the full Note user, who knows what they're doing in general, right? If you're a full Note user and you know what you're doing, then I think you're going to be fine. In general, I think, yeah, this is not too bad. Now, let's say you are a lot of false user. Let's say you don't know what you're doing or you do know what you're doing. I don't know. Big one. In the same scenario, you're on the longest chain, you're receiving coins for an exchange, and you've seen these headers out there. For this shorter chain, you might have seen them. Depends on whether they reach you or not. But it's a shorter chain and it's valid according to you, because it's a more strict rule set. So you're fine. So this other chain has Tap root and you don't probably. And you're accepting transactions and you're a happy camper. But then all of a sudden, because the world changes, everything disappears from under you. All the transactions you've seen confirmed during the block are now back in a Memphis, and it might have been double spent even. Yeah. The reason for that is that even if you're running lot is false. If the lot is true chain, we're talking about the change play this happen. So if your lot is false note, but at some point, at any point the lottest true chain becomes the longest chain, then your lot is false note would still accept that chain. It would still consider it valid the other way around is not true. But the lottery false note will always consider the lot is true chain valid. So in your scenario, we're using Bitcoin on the longest chain, on the latest false chain, we're happy we received money, we did a hard day of work, and we got our paycheck at the end paid in Bitcoin. We think we're safe. We got a bunch of confirmations. But then all of a sudden the lot is true chain becomes longer, which means your note switches to the lottest true chain. And that money you received on the Lotus false chain, which you fought, was the Bitcoin chain. It's just gone poof. Right. That's the problem you're talking about. Exactly. Now, you could still say, okay, I. Will add to this very briefly. I think this is an even bigger problem for non upgraded notes. Yeah, I was about to get to that. Okay, right. So now we're talking about a lot of false people. And you could still say, well, why did you download the latest false version? Well, because you didn't know. Okay, now we're talking about an unepgraded node. Now for the UN upgraded node. Taproo does not exist, so it has no preference for which of the change. It will just pick the longest one. It's someone in Korea. He doesn't keep up with discussion. He does not be mean to Korea. No. Well, pick a country where they don't speak English. North Korea. Yeah. Someone doesn't keep up with the Bitcoin discussion forums, maybe doesn't read English, doesn't really care. He just likes this Bitcoin thing downloaded the software a couple of years ago, now put in his hard days of work, get paid and the money disappears. Or his note might be in a nuclear bunker that he put it in five years ago under 15 meters of concrete air gapped, and he can give it and somehow it can download blocks because it's watching the block stream satellite or something, but it cannot be upgraded. Andy doesn't know about this upgrade, which would be odd if you're into nuclear bunkers and full notes. But anyway, somebody is running an out of date note, but in Bitcoin, we have the policy, you don't have to upgrade. It's not a mandatory thing. So it should be safe, or at least relatively safe to run an upgraded note. And then all of a sudden you're receiving your salary as sort of the same as a lot of salesperson, and then suddenly there's a giant reorder that just comes out of nowhere and you have no idea why people bother to reork because you don't know about this rule change. You don't see the difference. And Boof, your salary just disappeared. Yeah, that's bad. So that's basically the worst case scenario that no one wants, I think. Yeah. And you can translate also to say people who are using hardware wallet software that hasn't been updated or they're using remote nodes or they're using sort of SPV nodes that don't check the rules but only check the work. And they'll have similar experiences where suddenly the longest change changes. So your SPV wallet, which we explained in an earlier episode, it's history disappears. And at least for the lightweight notes, you could say you could do some victim shaming and say, well, you should be running a full node. And if bad things happen, then you should have run a full node. But I still don't think that's good safety engineering to tell people like, okay, if you do not use your seatbelt in the correct position, the car might explode. But at least for the unobtruded full note, that's an explicit case that I think Bitcoin is want to support. You want to support people not upgrading and not suddenly losing their coins in a situation like this. Yes. That's where I want to get at. So then everyone agrees, or at least we both agree. And I think most people would agree that this scenario we just painted, that's horrible. We don't want that. The next question is how do you actually avoid this scenario? ",

And to think that alternatives or all coins treat this like a move fast and break things. You begin to understand what it's a great analogy to try to wrap your head around.

Previous changes to the protocol required just 55% of the miners to reach the threshold. Now the only two proposals for taproot are 90 and 95%. The reluctance to put this thing at risk becomes greater and greater and that's why I think in the not too distant future, outside of very minor cleanups and maybe very long term changes to the protocol is that bitcoin will largely occupy that this thing will basically stop in the vast majority of its development and essentially become that bedrock. And I think the only alternative to that. Or the only case in which it will be really important to make some sort of a change or software is if the nuclear scenario where it appears that quantum computing may actually pose a threat in the not too distant future or something like that and we need to actually go to some sort of other encryption algorithm or something like that. But I find that increasingly unlikely. The more and more I actually learn about it, the less it looks like much of anything. But we'll probably do an episode more seriously about that in the not too distant future. Real quick though, I wanted to hit the last part of Allen Reiner's quote which I just think is just so beautiful and perfectly hits how important this thing is before we close it out. Let's thank our sponsors one more time. Hexa wallet actually just got to do their recovery process twice over the weekend and it was pretty cool that it was seedless and they just kind of scanned a handful of QR codes and then rebuilt my wallet so that was really neat. And then more and more I'm using my Bitbox two, the more I love it. I've had a lot of people say it really is the best like the most user friendly option out there. And then, of course, our new sponsor level co L-V-L Co. This service is going to be a big deal and I'm a little bit infuriated. They are not in North Carolina yet, but fingers crossed. Don't forget to check them out for a free bitcoin exchange with no fees and bitcoin banking services. So thank you to those guys for supporting the audible of the bitcoin space. Now this last comment and Allen Reiner, the second half of it was that there is more than just a piece of software at stake. Whatever goes in needs to be as hard as diamond. And I just thought that was such a cool quote is that this is what it's about. It's about having the community, the network itself, defend a set of consensus rules and any and everything within the code that is run is as hard as diamond. Because then, and only then, do we secure a monetary policy that's harder than gold and one that is provably secure from political capture. And with that as our foundation as hard as diamond, we can build anything on top of it. And that's what we're going to do. Thank you guys so much for listening to Bitcoin Audible. I have got some great reads and episodes coming for the rest of the week, so don't miss it. And until next time, everybody take it easy.

      "text": "Hi, you're listening to Stefan Livera podcast show about Bitcoin today for episode 289. We're talking about this idea of taking Bitcoin and Lightning network to a billion users and roast beef. Lalo, the CTO of Lighting Labs rejoins me on the show to talk about this and updates on where the Lightning network is today, what's going on with Lightning Labs and LNG, and of course, how to take Bitcoin and Lightning to a billion users. So with Taproot coming in, we talk a little bit about the implications of this, as well as potential future upgrades such as any prevalent which will enable L two, enabling a much more advanced version of the Lightning network. And how would it work if normally we're thinking of channels as a two of two situation. Well, what does that look like in a multiparty channel situation? This show brought to you by Swan Bitcoin. Swan is the best way to accumulate Bitcoin with automatic recurring buyers and instant buyers. Swan offer a really fast and cheap set up so you can automate your stacking plan. If you've heard my recent episode with House, you know the importance of automating your DCA. I like Swan's focus on education and content because the more you know, the more you buy. And Swan are also Bitcoin only, so there's no confusion with altcoins. This is the best place to send your pre coroner and new Coiner friends. Also, if you're planning to buy more than $100,000 of Bitcoin over the next year, Swan Private team is there to help you. They are there for anyone internationally high net worth corporate business customers. Swan Private provides additional one on one guidance.

      "text": "Root Activation The Tap Root code will be included in the upcoming Bitcoin core release, currently the de facto reference implementation for the Bitcoin protocol. However, this release will not include activation logic just yet. This is expected to be included in an upcoming Bitcoin core release as a backwards compatible soft fork upgrade. Tap Root activation is presumed to happen smoothly if a large majority of miners enforce the upgrade. Previous softwares were activated through BIP Nine, which triggered enforcement of the new protocol rules when 95% of all hash power on the network signaled support for the upgrade. Largely due to the long, painful and messy activation process for Bitcoin's last consensus protocol upgrade SegWit in 2017. Bitcoin developers have been discussing whether BIP Nine is still the best way to activate Softworks. Some now prefer BIP Eight, which if so configured, would not just enforce the new rules when a large majority of miners signal supports for the upgrade, but would also activate the upgrade at a specific future date or block height, known as a user activated soft fork. Some smaller changes to the upgrade mechanism are also being discussed. Some argue that the hash power thresholds should be lower than 95%, for example, and there's also debate on the preferred duration before the upgrade should be enforced automatically, if at all. Specific proposals also include a combination of these ideas, which could perhaps even involve a special Bitcoin core software fork to get the job done, like the BIP 148 client, which, according to many, nudged minors to activate SegWit in 2017. Paulin CEO Kevin Pan told Bitcoin magazine that his team prefers Taproot to be activated through BIP Nine, though not outright rejecting BIP Eight with forced activation. Quote Unlike during the Segment activation process, there is no heated debate around Taproot, and BIP Nine has also been used successfully before segment, he said. We therefore preferred the old school way BIP Nine, but the community could still have a useractivated soft fork. Pan does prefer the activation to happen through Bitcoin Core and believes that the 95% threshold is fine if BIP Eight with forced activation is chosen instead. He thinks one year is a good amount of time before the new rules are enforced. But whichever solution is chosen, the Pool and CEO believes Bitcoin Core developers will make the right choice.

The scenarios are straightforward. In either case, tap Root would probably activate during the activation period. If not, the upgrade would activate by the end of the year in the case of Not True and miners would have little choice but to accept this. Else they would mine blocks that the network rejects and they'd be wasting their hash power. Or, in the case of Lot False, the proposal would expire and a new activation period would be deployed, this time presumably using Lot True, unless consensus already shifted to Lot True before the end of the activation period, in which case Tap Root would also activate before the year is over. It becomes more complex if there is no consensus on either Lot True or Lot False. In the unlikely event that the activation period expires and one segment of the network runs Lot True clients, while another segment runs Lot False clients, it comes down to the support for each option. We will ignore a third but important segment for now users that run neither Lot True nor Lot False. More on this group in a Bit. The first thing to note is that if any majority of miners by hash power signals support and uses Lot True, tap Root is guaranteed to upgrade, these miners would, by the end of the activation period start rejecting blocks that don't signal readiness. And since they would produce a longer blockchain in the minority of non signaling minors, and because both Lot True and Lot False clients would accept this chain as valid, everyone would accept this taproot signaling blockchain and activate the upgrade. In other words, the hash rate power activation threshold would in the last weeks effectively drop from 90% to 51%. But if less than half of all miners use Lot True and the signaling period expires, the Bitcoin blockchain could split between Lot True and Lot False clients. Lot True nodes would only accept signaling blocks. Even if non signaling blocks make a longer blockchain, they would essentially be on their own Lot True chain. Lot False nodes, meanwhile, would reject the Lot True chain in favor of the longer Lot False chain. The result would be a blockchain fork and ultimately perhaps two different blockchains, each with their own transaction history and essentially their own coins, potentially with their own exchange rates. A coin split. Users of either blockchain might consider their own version the real bitcoin. Barring further protocol changes on the Lot False chain, however, the Lot True chain would in this case have a strong game theoretic advantage. Lot True nodes and miners would never accept the Lot False chain, no matter how much longer it were to become. In a, quote, worst case scenario, it would remain a minority coin. Lot False Nodes, in contrast, would accept the Lot True chain if it ever became the longer chain. They'd then abandon their own Lot False chain and lose any coins they received or mined on it since the split. In short, Lot False nodes and miners would risk losing money, therefore, they'd have a strong incentive to just join the Lot True chain before this can happen, especially since they presumably don't object to the taproot upgrade itself. The incentive to join the Lot True chain would be particularly strong if most users prefer the Lot True chain or more accurately, if this chain would have the, quote, economic majority. If most of the Bitcoin economy prefers to accept and hold coins on a hypothetical Lot True chain, these coins should demand a higher price and more transaction fees, which would draw in the most minors. This would in turn ensure that the Lot True chain becomes the longest and therefore the only chain. Here's the rub the incentive to join the Lot True chain before a potential split to be on the, quote, safe side would only have an effect if users and miners are aware of what's going on. To begin with, anyone who assumed that Lot False would be the upgrade mechanism and therefore didn't switch could still lose money if and when a split occurs and the Lot False chain is abandoned afterwards. The same is true for the third segment of users, the segment we ignored so far but is actually important to take into consideration users that run neither Lot True nor Not False.

      "text": "a couple of different ways to put DLCs on chain or sorry, DLCs on Lightning off chain. One of them that I think will be first is to put them directly in channels. So essentially you use your channel as a ledger in this two person universe. It's like it's own blockchain almost. Not exactly, but it has a similar interface and it has the same script mechanism, same enforcement rules as Bitcoin. So you build it using the same Bitcoin tooling to build all these off chain transactions off of your channel, so on and so forth. Kind of acts like you'd think it would within a Lightning channel, but this only enables DLCs between two parties. I think this will be particularly useful for synthetic assets because how synthetic assets work is that at the end of the day, everyone's using Bitcoin, but certain people have price exposure to something else instead of Bitcoin. And so if I'm paying over the Lightning network and I've like a USD channel or a USD denominated channel, the person who I'm paying still get stats, right? Maybe they also have a USD denominated channel, but if they do it, that's between them and the person next to them on the route. Right. But at the end of the day, so the translation is kind of like the back end is Bitcoin all the time, but then only the last step on either side might be synthetic still. So for those kinds of applications in channel, DLCs, I think make the most sense in part because you don't have to worry about this exact problem of like locking up funds of all these things in between. Now there's a bunch of new ones there. I don't think they're worth going into right now. The other way of doing BLC is this routed way. I have figured out how to do this using PTLCs. So I don't believe that I know how to do this on the current Lightning network. So I do. It requires a bunch of zero offs between a bunch of people. So it's not worth it. Much more difficult to work. Yeah, it's more difficult than say, implementing Taproot based Lightning channel. Okay, well, on that, let's go ahead and get into PTLCs. So currently a hash time lock contract is basically that. There's a hash of a secret that the receiver has. And I am sending you a payment. You send me the hash of the secret. You send me the fingerprint of the secret and I lock a payment to Bob and then to you with the fingerprint of that secret. And as soon as you reveal the secret, it unlocks it to Bob and then Bob unlocks it to me. And that cascades the payment goes through. But the key about hash time lock contracts is that it's obvious between you and Bob and me and Bob that we're using the exact same fingerprint. That is, these are obvious to Bob. Yeah. And to anybody else who can maybe see like they know that, okay, the one that I sent to Bob is also the exact same one as the Bob sent to you. Yeah. And the nice thing is that all of these checks are just local. Right. If you're routing the payment, you just want to make sure that the incoming and the outgoing have the same hash is the only thing you care about. Right. Because that means that you're never going to be the one with the bill. You can always either nothing happens or you can pass it on to someone else. That's the thing you care about as a routing note.

Bet was a lot of fun. I recommend it. All right. I recommend going short. I'll think about it. Check it out next time. Yeah. I think I foam bought the 2022 tickets. Yes, actually. So I think you read that. But we're thinking of well, we're not just thinking about it. We're going to wrap up some kind of deal for open source developers. Details to be announced and to be figured out, I think. But we're planning on some sort of access for. So now I have a short Bitcoin position for no good reason. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. But being back in the Netherlands is nice. It's just as hot here as it was in Miami. Yes, except no air conditioning. Except. Yeah, that's the big difference. At least in Miami. At least in the United States, if you're inside somewhere, then it's cool. But in the Netherlands, you're just going to be sweating inside all day long. The other thing that happened last week, Besides me returning to the great country of the Netherlands is yours. Tap Root. Tap Root locked in. And that's locked in, but locked underscore in. We did it. We did. Well, we didn't, but people did. Sure. We're going to discuss Tapoot. We're going to discuss tapewood one more time. I think this is going to be the last time we've discussed Tapoot itself. We've then had, I think, two or maybe even three episodes on Softwork activation, tablet activation. Two, probably right. Or maybe one on speed trial anyways, a bunch of them. And now we're going to do one more on Tap Root lock in. So let's start at the beginning. ",

          "text": "Life from Wizards. This is Stephen Williams, NATO. Hello. Welcome back. Thank you. Shaurs. Was it warm? Yeah, it's warm here as well. It was fun. It was a lot of fun. Cool. Bet was a lot of fun. I recommend it. All right. I recommend going short. I'll think about it. Check it out next time. Yeah. I think I foam bought the 2022 tickets. Yes, actually. So I think you read that. But we're thinking of well, we're not just thinking about it. We're going to wrap up some kind of deal for open source developers. Details to be announced and to be figured out, I think. But we're planning on some sort of access for. So now I have a short Bitcoin position for no good reason. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. But being back in the Netherlands is nice. It's just as hot here as it was in Miami. Yes, except no air conditioning. Except. Yeah, that's the big difference. At least in Miami. At least in the United States, if you're inside somewhere, then it's cool. But in the Netherlands, you're just going to be sweating inside all day long. The other thing that happened last week, Besides me returning to the great country of the Netherlands is yours. Tap Root. Tap Root locked in. And that's locked in, but locked underscore in. We did it. We did. Well, we didn't, but people did. Sure. We're going to discuss Tapoot. We're going to discuss tapewood one more time. I think this is going to be the last time we've discussed Tapoot itself. We've then had, I think, two or maybe even three episodes on Softwork activation, tablet activation. Two, probably right. Or maybe one on speed trial anyways, a bunch of them. And now we're going to do one more on Tap Root lock in. So let's start at the beginning. ",

      "text": "All right. So what if it's activated? What can we expect? What is the Bitcoin Core wallet is going to do for us? Let's move to that point. Yes. Why should everyone be happy or why? Well, let's first start with something really dull and boring before we go there. But it is Bitcoin Core related. So in the next hopefully grandiose version of Bitcoin Core version 22, there's going to be a new RPC method that. Will tell you what is an RPC method. It's a sort of a commandline thing that you can use against your node or you can do it in the. Little window plug software in it and programs and do stuff with your notes, right? Yeah, exactly. So it's not in the graphical interface, but it is pretty easy to use. And this will tell you how many miners are still signaling? Because the idea is that during this lock in phase, miners should continue to signal they don't have to, but it's recommended so that you can see that upgraded and didn't accidentally downgrade or forgot that they upgraded. So it will be possible to monitor that. So that's good. But maybe. Is that all we're going to get for Taproot, like being able to see if it exists? Probably. Maybe you want to do a little bit more. So the other thing that Big Concor is working on is support for wallets that actually have tapped nice and hopefully, well, definitely some of that will be in version 22, but hopefully a lot of it. I did not mean that as a pun, by the way. So the first thing that would be in the wallet is a way to watch to watch these tapwood addresses. So they would be watch only. You wouldn't be able to spin from them, but you'd be able to watch them. Right. And those would be really any kind those would only be very simple tap root addresses too. So for example, you're receiving just on a public key, or you can have some scripts, but only very simple scripts. So in other words, you cannot do some super sophisticated multi sick set up yet in Bitcoin Core, not even to watch it. So this is all just one step at a time. We're talking about Bitcoin two, right. The upcoming release. Yeah. And that part is already in it, so I think that will make it. Into the release so you can monitor what's going on on the network. Basically, you can create a watch only wallet. It's just that if you want to spend it now, you need to do something manually. Right. So the next step, of course, is that they can also sign tap of transactions, but again, only very simple type of transactions. And from the last time I checked, the simplest. So to recap that real brief in like 10 seconds, because we haven't mentioned this at all yet. But Saprus allows for all sorts of complex spending conditions, and in an ideal scenario, spending from these conditions will be indistinguishable from a regular transaction. Yeah. So that regular transaction is the thing. That'S been also regular transactions even in Taproot. And that's going to be implemented in Bitcoin Core 22. Is that what you said? Yeah. At least in some experimental part of it. Right. It's probably not going to be on by default. You can't do the very complex stuff yet in bitcoincode 22, but you can do the simple spanss that are actually still typhoid spins that look like a template. Yeah. So you can just create a receive address that starts with one BCP, I. Think BC one Q. Oh, BC one P. Yeah. Instead of BC one Q, start with BC one P. You'll be able to receive coins on that. You can already try it on Signet because the temperature is already active there, as well as some slightly more complicated scenarios. But then the last time I checked, it would not give you the correct fee if it was a more complicated scenario. There's a lot of work to be done, right? To be very clear, we're talking about Bitcoin Core 22. Now, anyone else, any wallet, anyone clever enough to work with this stuff can of course, starting in November, do all of this fancy type of stuff. It's just based on course, sort of taking it slow. They're starting with regular temporary transactions, and then down the line, presumably more options will be added. Exactly. So this is a Bitcoin Core. The wallet is part of big concern, Core. Right. So the big one Core node will verify all those complicated conditions so you can use them. It's just that you'll have to write your own wallet, right? Exactly. Yup. But it's nice to have Bitcoin Core also have an example wallet, if only so people can sanity check that it really works as they think it does. So if you're really impatient and you want to roll your own wallet, first of all, only do that on test. Net and on Signet. But you can look at the chain called Workshop that they did two years ago, that they did a tap root workshop. And part of that workshop was Python notebooks. That in those Python notebooks you would construct tapworth transactions completely from scratch, like starting with two public keys and adding them up and creating all these very cool. And there might be some tweaks that need to be made because I don't know if they updated the workshop with all the latest changes to the specification, but you can use that to roll your own wallet. Like I said, like a test wallet. That's the only one I'm aware of. What I'm hoping to see is hardware wallets implement this stuff. Yeah. I'm personally not aware of a lot of the tap root software that's actually in development, and that probably makes sense, right? Software developers in general presumably want to wait before spending a lot of time working on tapwood stuff until topping is actually locked in. It depends on their business plan, if they have any right, maybe they want to be the first to market. Then it makes sense to have everything ready long before it activates. But not long. I mean, up until last week, there was a real risk that it would be a huge waste of time if it hadn't locked in or activated at all. It makes sense that developers will only start focusing on it now, don't you think? It does depends on what your plan is like. If you have a plan that you know you can execute in six months, then sure wait for the lock in. If you have a plan that takes two years, then maybe you were already working on this. Fair enough. That I don't know do you have. Any idea how much I'm sweating? No, but the nice thing is, because of this pandemic, we have a nice social distancing, so it's not my problem. All right, move on. We're moving on. Yeah. I just wanted to add that just to compare to the past. So when Segreg came alive, when it was activated, after much drama, after much more time as well, I don't think there were any wallets, or maybe one, but at least there was no Bitcoin core support for it in the wallet. That took another year. And the reason for that was because the Bitcoin core wallet was an absolute mess. And now it is not a mess. It is much more flexible and much more powerful, which is why adding Tap to it is going a lot faster than last time. And we might even have some wallet support before it activates. So that's very cool. But we'll just have to see what the other people are doing. And maybe one more point that I have is outside of wallets, we know that the Lightning folks are really excited about that route because it allows them to do cool stuff. So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do. And it might make sense for them to try all that stuff on Cignet and just have it ready to maybe even already have it in chip code and just say, like, this thing is, we're going to start using Tapu for new channels as soon as it activates and it's already rolled out. So all your peers already have Tap, too. You don't have to wait. I think the main benefit is that Lightning closing channels, as long as it's cooperative, will in fact look like regular Bitcoin transactions. That's one advantage. The other is that if you're doing a transaction, you have a payment hash right now. And that payment hash is sort of a fingerprint that is being given to all the intermediate nodes. And with hair, you can use points a different point for each node in the process. So you're going to have a much. Better price thanks to Snore signatures. This is thanks to Snore. Yeah. Which is part of the type of upgrades. Yes. And I have no idea how easy that is to implement. Maybe somebody already did. Maybe they're going to try and find out that it's quite hard. I'm not up to date. We should talk to somebody who is more up to date on Lightning. That's an excellent idea. Also, a little bit of a spoiler or not a teaser. A teaser. A teaser is much better. Stay tuned, folks. Sure. Last question. ",

      "text": "are in addition to what we look at from a public network perspective, which everyone has access to with regard to capacity and number of channels and all that different stuff. Right. Okay. I want to get into Tarot now. I want to understand more about this project and exactly how it works because you guys put out a blog post about it. I believe it was announced right before the Bitcoin conference. For those who aren't familiar, can we start with just a high level definition of what Tarot is and maybe its relationship to tap root? Yeah, absolutely. So Tarot is an open protocol that's sort of made possible by tap root top route is a recent upgrade to Bitcoin that sort of enables greater contracting capabilities along with sort of Privacy and efficiency benefits. Right. And so Taro is a tap root powered protocol for issuing assets on the Bitcoin blockchain that can then be transferred over the Lightning network for the benefits of sort of instant high volume, low fee transactions. And so Taro enables Bitcoin to serve as this sort of protocol of value. It allows app developers to integrate assets alongside Bitcoin in apps, both on chain and over Lightning. And this expands the reach of the Lightning network as a whole. It brings more users to the network who then drive more volume and liquidity in Bitcoin and allow people to have more routing fees if you're sort of a routing node on the network. And so more network volume means more routing fees, and they get that sort of benefit of a multi asset network without needing to actually support any assets. And we can talk about sort of the design of Taro and why we're super excited about the way that it's designed from a lightning network perspective. Yeah. Okay. First, I want to get into the topic of assets because I think the word asset is a very broad term, that it means a lot of different things to different people. A new asset on Bitcoin could be a stable coin. It could be a Fiat currency. It could be an NFT. Right. It could be a totally different crypto asset. Is there any particular kinds of assets you guys, you guys had in mind here? Is it trying to be as flexible as possible to enable any asset? Yeah. I mean, I think the use cases that we're most excited about, and again, this is a protocol, so there will be the ability to build different things. But I think the use cases that at least I'm most excited about is we hear so much from builders and people like Alex Claudestein who work in emerging markets that people there want exposure to stable coins or dollars. Right. And whatever the reason may be that maybe they have expenses in Fiat, maybe they are scared about the stability or volatility of Bitcoin price. Personally, I may save in Bitcoin, but if we hear about that demand from those builders in those emerging markets over and over again, it's something that we want to build a solution to. We want to solve that problem. And I think that if we give these individuals, these users, these builders, the ability to provide that stablecoin or Fiat exposure in a Bitcoin and lightning native way, ultimately that allows for people to transition into becoming more Bitcoin or wanting more Bitcoin as they watch the different things play out as they see like, okay, I have the stable coin balance. Maybe I have this Bitcoin balance within a wallet and I can kind of see how the two interact. And maybe I start to save more in Bitcoin and spend more in Fiat. And so I think the use case that I'm personally most excited about is meeting the needs of those emerging market users who are clamoring for this need for stable coins and the need for dollars. And then what follows from that, I think, is easier adoption, easier education of people into the Bitcoin ecosystem in the Bitcoin world. So in a way, this is kind of a gateway towards Bitcoin. You view this as like, if you can open up access to stable coins, that's a step closer for people to then move into adopting Bitcoin that's the idea exactly. The onramps are so much easier if you think about, okay, how do people buy it now in emerging markets? And some people don't have bank account, some people just have cash. And so that on ramp into getting the actual asset to be able to purchase Bitcoin can be difficult. If we have that on ramp or we have that stablecoin that lives directly within the same experience of being able to purchase Bitcoin or whatever it may be, then I think that on ramp and that sort of move for people into Bitcoin is way easier. Got it. How is Lightning Labs planning to monetize Tarot, or is it at all? Is Lightning Labs going to be an asset issuer? Is there going to be a spread? What are some of the things you guys are thinking about in terms of how do you earn from creating this protocol? Yeah, it's an interesting question. First, I will just say we have no plans to issue assets. We're building a protocol for the possibility of issuing assets, and there will be partners who potentially issue those assets. Lightning lots won't be issuing our own stable point or anything along those lines. But in terms of monetization, I think it's really early ultimately. I think, again, what I love about Lightning Labs is there's this focus on the mission. Right. And then the mission is bringing Bitcoin to billions of people. And I think as part of that, we've heard these countless stories from lightning builders about users wanting this exposure to stable point within a Lightning wallet. Right. And so what we're focused on right now is building Taro from a protocol perspective, getting the code out there, launching it. We went through the spec process specifically so the community could provide feedback and give us some more direction about where to go. And so we're focused on delivering that protocol. I think ultimately, our belief is that with Taro assets on Lightning, we'll see pretty large growth of routing activity. We will see additional routing activity on the network. And so that means more routing fees for routing node operators, but it also probably means more usage of stuff like loop and pool to make sure that liquidity is in the right place at the right time. And so as we think about quote unquote demonetization of Paro, there's the possibility there that increased routing traffic drives more revenue to loop and pool, and then there's some integrations with loop and pool that we could pursue in the future. But right now we're super focused on just delivering the target code and the protocol itself. Right. In a world where Taro is implemented. And let's say just for listeners, for simplicity's sake, there's one new asset, and that new asset is going to be Lightning US dollars stablecoin, right? Yeah. In that circumstance, how does having that additional asset on the Lightning network affect routing node operators? What changes will they see as a result of this added asset. I'm really glad you asked about this. I think one of my favorite parts of the design of Taro is all of the sort of Taro asset stuff happens at the edges of the network. So the core of the network, which obviously runs on Bitcoin liquidity, can basically remain entirely the same while the edges of the network deal with the Taro assets. So in this way, the existing Bitcoin liquidity on the network can be leveraged to route Taro assets. There isn't the need to spin up an entirely new and separate network, and I have to bootstrap that. And so Elizabeth coined this phrase or meme that Taro plus lightning will enable for us to basically Bitcoinize the dollar, which I think is brilliant. We bring the dollar onto these Bitcoin and lightning rails. Right. And that allows for, again, the edges handle the Taro assets. The core of the routing network doesn't necessarily have to. And this means that Tauro can have a faster time to market and be useful earlier. And it means that those routing networks at the core are likely to see a lot of increased volume because of the interest in having Lightning USD and the interest in moving that around. But they don't necessarily have to do anything different. They don't have to support target assets or anything like that. The routing bump just comes to them as a part of the core lightning network. So if you're on one end of the network and I'm on the other and you're trying to send me $10 of Lightning USD, how does that work then? Is the Lightning USD on your side routed through the network as Bitcoin and then just flipped at the final stage to Lightning USD? Is that the idea? Exactly. So it's the first hop and the last hop that actually has to deal with the sort of conversion to a Lightning USD. But the hops in the middle don't actually have to know about the existence of it. They're just routing Bitcoin like they would for any other payment. Now, could that work in reverse? If demand for Lightning USD is so great and everyone starts using it for that purpose, could the opposite happen where people begin sending Bitcoin through the network and it's being routed through Lightning USD nodes? Is that a possibility? I haven't really thought about it that much, but I think that with the existing network effects and liquidity effects that we have around Bitcoin in the network today, I think it's 3900 Bitcoin, and there's this whole network graph built on top of Bitcoin routing and all that different stuff. I think that those network effects will mean that Bitcoin is kind of always the core of the network and that these assets kind of live at the edges and you can route through the Bitcoin core of the network and have these assets reach people on the edges. But the core is running through Bitcoin and fees are paid in Bitcoin and all that different good stuff. Got it. So even if we're routing Lightning USD to each other, or you're sending Lightning USD to me, maybe the people earning on the way, the routing nodes are all earning in Bitcoin. Yes, absolutely. And so that's what kind of part of what we mean when Elizabeth talks about Bitcoin as a dollar. Right. You take this dollar, you put it on Bitcoin Lightning rails. You have to be a much more efficient system using Lightning network. But the people who are routing it are actually earning Bitcoin. And that's the super exciting part about it for me from a design perspective, is, again, these routing, their operators don't have to change anything. They don't have to do anything. We expect there will be a lot of demand for routing these assets, and so they'll get a bump in routing revenue, but they don't necessarily have to do anything to make that happen. Now, how does the asset issuance work? How do you think about is there any regulatory consideration here? What might be the interface that customers use to acquire Lightning USD or some other asset? How does that component work? That to me is still a little fuzzy. Yeah. I think that as we release the Tarot code and all the different protocol elements, there will come more into focus. But basically it's an open protocol for issuing assets. So any issuer can issue assets through this Tarot code that we'll put out, and we'll be able to create an asset on the Bitcoin blockchain and then theoretically raise that to the lighting network. I think there are considerations around inbound and outbound liquidity of these assets and how that will be sourced and different components there. Just because as you think about the lighting network, you think about that liquidity management, you'll have to have considerations there. So from an issuer perspective, this is an open protocol, so anybody will be able to look at it, use it, issue assets, and the users and routing node operators and developers in the ecosystem that comes up around Taro will ultimately decide what assets are playing a large role in the ecosystem and all that different stuff. Yeah. It's such a broad topic that I struggle to sometimes think about what assets could be added because I recognize the word asset means so much. Like, do you think that there's a future where there's a foreign exchange market deployed on Sataro, or is there a stock exchange on Taro? What are the limitations of the protocol? And I guess outside of the conversation around stablecoins, which I think at this point people recognize as a very real demand for the crypto industry, people want stable coins. What are some of the other demands that you think people are going to have when this protocol is implemented? Yeah, I think it's a really fascinating question and something that we're excited to see unfold. I think part of the reason again, why I love working at Lightning Labs and being a part of this platform business is we get to create these protocols and have these things that make building on Lightning better for builders, developers, entrepreneurs, and then we can see where they take it. We don't have to necessarily have a strong opinion about the direction that it should go or will go. I would put that as a challenge to builders who are considering Lightning. I think when Taro comes out, when the protocol comes out, you'll have the ability to take a look at it and see what is possible. I think stuff like NFT's, any arbitrary asset theoretically can be issued through Taro, and it's just going to be sort of the builders and users who guide us in terms of what the use cases that make sense end up being. Similar to the way Lightning spun up. We couldn't have possibly imagined necessarily that Podcasting 2.0 or something like Stacker News would exist. But it's basically a bet on the creativity of these entrepreneurs, of these people who are passionate about Lightning, passionate about Bitcoin and building on those things. So I'm confident we'll see a wide variety of potential use cases. But in terms of predicting exactly what those will be, I'll leave that up to the creativity of the people that we work with and of the entrepreneurs who are reaching these new users. Fair enough. Will we see the same kind of, like, Privacy first design on Taro as there is on the Lightning network? Do you think that's realistic to expect? Yeah, I mean, I think because Taro is Taproot native, built on Taproot, there are certain Privacy components that come with that. And so, yeah, I think that the design being Taproot native helps ensure some of those Privacy components. Okay, ",

          "text": "are in addition to what we look at from a public network perspective, which everyone has access to with regard to capacity and number of channels and all that different stuff. Right. Okay. I want to get into Tarot now. I want to understand more about this project and exactly how it works because you guys put out a blog post about it. I believe it was announced right before the Bitcoin conference. For those who aren't familiar, can we start with just a high level definition of what Tarot is and maybe its relationship to tap root? Yeah, absolutely. So Tarot is an open protocol that's sort of made possible by tap root top route is a recent upgrade to Bitcoin that sort of enables greater contracting capabilities along with sort of Privacy and efficiency benefits. Right. And so Taro is a tap root powered protocol for issuing assets on the Bitcoin blockchain that can then be transferred over the Lightning network for the benefits of sort of instant high volume, low fee transactions. And so Taro enables Bitcoin to serve as this sort of protocol of value. It allows app developers to integrate assets alongside Bitcoin in apps, both on chain and over Lightning. And this expands the reach of the Lightning network as a whole. It brings more users to the network who then drive more volume and liquidity in Bitcoin and allow people to have more routing fees if you're sort of a routing node on the network. And so more network volume means more routing fees, and they get that sort of benefit of a multi asset network without needing to actually support any assets. And we can talk about sort of the design of Taro and why we're super excited about the way that it's designed from a lightning network perspective. Yeah. Okay. First, I want to get into the topic of assets because I think the word asset is a very broad term, that it means a lot of different things to different people. A new asset on Bitcoin could be a stable coin. It could be a Fiat currency. It could be an NFT. Right. It could be a totally different crypto asset. Is there any particular kinds of assets you guys, you guys had in mind here? Is it trying to be as flexible as possible to enable any asset? Yeah. I mean, I think the use cases that we're most excited about, and again, this is a protocol, so there will be the ability to build different things. But I think the use cases that at least I'm most excited about is we hear so much from builders and people like Alex Claudestein who work in emerging markets that people there want exposure to stable coins or dollars. Right. And whatever the reason may be that maybe they have expenses in Fiat, maybe they are scared about the stability or volatility of Bitcoin price. Personally, I may save in Bitcoin, but if we hear about that demand from those builders in those emerging markets over and over again, it's something that we want to build a solution to. We want to solve that problem. And I think that if we give these individuals, these users, these builders, the ability to provide that stablecoin or Fiat exposure in a Bitcoin and lightning native way, ultimately that allows for people to transition into becoming more Bitcoin or wanting more Bitcoin as they watch the different things play out as they see like, okay, I have the stable coin balance. Maybe I have this Bitcoin balance within a wallet and I can kind of see how the two interact. And maybe I start to save more in Bitcoin and spend more in Fiat. And so I think the use case that I'm personally most excited about is meeting the needs of those emerging market users who are clamoring for this need for stable coins and the need for dollars. And then what follows from that, I think, is easier adoption, easier education of people into the Bitcoin ecosystem in the Bitcoin world. So in a way, this is kind of a gateway towards Bitcoin. You view this as like, if you can open up access to stable coins, that's a step closer for people to then move into adopting Bitcoin that's the idea exactly. The onramps are so much easier if you think about, okay, how do people buy it now in emerging markets? And some people don't have bank account, some people just have cash. And so that on ramp into getting the actual asset to be able to purchase Bitcoin can be difficult. If we have that on ramp or we have that stablecoin that lives directly within the same experience of being able to purchase Bitcoin or whatever it may be, then I think that on ramp and that sort of move for people into Bitcoin is way easier. Got it. How is Lightning Labs planning to monetize Tarot, or is it at all? Is Lightning Labs going to be an asset issuer? Is there going to be a spread? What are some of the things you guys are thinking about in terms of how do you earn from creating this protocol? Yeah, it's an interesting question. First, I will just say we have no plans to issue assets. We're building a protocol for the possibility of issuing assets, and there will be partners who potentially issue those assets. Lightning lots won't be issuing our own stable point or anything along those lines. But in terms of monetization, I think it's really early ultimately. I think, again, what I love about Lightning Labs is there's this focus on the mission. Right. And then the mission is bringing Bitcoin to billions of people. And I think as part of that, we've heard these countless stories from lightning builders about users wanting this exposure to stable point within a Lightning wallet. Right. And so what we're focused on right now is building Taro from a protocol perspective, getting the code out there, launching it. We went through the spec process specifically so the community could provide feedback and give us some more direction about where to go. And so we're focused on delivering that protocol. I think ultimately, our belief is that with Taro assets on Lightning, we'll see pretty large growth of routing activity. We will see additional routing activity on the network. And so that means more routing fees for routing node operators, but it also probably means more usage of stuff like loop and pool to make sure that liquidity is in the right place at the right time. And so as we think about quote unquote demonetization of Paro, there's the possibility there that increased routing traffic drives more revenue to loop and pool, and then there's some integrations with loop and pool that we could pursue in the future. But right now we're super focused on just delivering the target code and the protocol itself. Right. In a world where Taro is implemented. And let's say just for listeners, for simplicity's sake, there's one new asset, and that new asset is going to be Lightning US dollars stablecoin, right? Yeah. In that circumstance, how does having that additional asset on the Lightning network affect routing node operators? What changes will they see as a result of this added asset. I'm really glad you asked about this. I think one of my favorite parts of the design of Taro is all of the sort of Taro asset stuff happens at the edges of the network. So the core of the network, which obviously runs on Bitcoin liquidity, can basically remain entirely the same while the edges of the network deal with the Taro assets. So in this way, the existing Bitcoin liquidity on the network can be leveraged to route Taro assets. There isn't the need to spin up an entirely new and separate network, and I have to bootstrap that. And so Elizabeth coined this phrase or meme that Taro plus lightning will enable for us to basically Bitcoinize the dollar, which I think is brilliant. We bring the dollar onto these Bitcoin and lightning rails. Right. And that allows for, again, the edges handle the Taro assets. The core of the routing network doesn't necessarily have to. And this means that Tauro can have a faster time to market and be useful earlier. And it means that those routing networks at the core are likely to see a lot of increased volume because of the interest in having Lightning USD and the interest in moving that around. But they don't necessarily have to do anything different. They don't have to support target assets or anything like that. The routing bump just comes to them as a part of the core lightning network. So if you're on one end of the network and I'm on the other and you're trying to send me $10 of Lightning USD, how does that work then? Is the Lightning USD on your side routed through the network as Bitcoin and then just flipped at the final stage to Lightning USD? Is that the idea? Exactly. So it's the first hop and the last hop that actually has to deal with the sort of conversion to a Lightning USD. But the hops in the middle don't actually have to know about the existence of it. They're just routing Bitcoin like they would for any other payment. Now, could that work in reverse? If demand for Lightning USD is so great and everyone starts using it for that purpose, could the opposite happen where people begin sending Bitcoin through the network and it's being routed through Lightning USD nodes? Is that a possibility? I haven't really thought about it that much, but I think that with the existing network effects and liquidity effects that we have around Bitcoin in the network today, I think it's 3900 Bitcoin, and there's this whole network graph built on top of Bitcoin routing and all that different stuff. I think that those network effects will mean that Bitcoin is kind of always the core of the network and that these assets kind of live at the edges and you can route through the Bitcoin core of the network and have these assets reach people on the edges. But the core is running through Bitcoin and fees are paid in Bitcoin and all that different good stuff. Got it. So even if we're routing Lightning USD to each other, or you're sending Lightning USD to me, maybe the people earning on the way, the routing nodes are all earning in Bitcoin. Yes, absolutely. And so that's what kind of part of what we mean when Elizabeth talks about Bitcoin as a dollar. Right. You take this dollar, you put it on Bitcoin Lightning rails. You have to be a much more efficient system using Lightning network. But the people who are routing it are actually earning Bitcoin. And that's the super exciting part about it for me from a design perspective, is, again, these routing, their operators don't have to change anything. They don't have to do anything. We expect there will be a lot of demand for routing these assets, and so they'll get a bump in routing revenue, but they don't necessarily have to do anything to make that happen.

      "text": "not true and lot false. The mechanics of both the lot true and lot false options are straightforward. In either case, miners have a year to activate Tap Root through hash power signaling. If, within that year, 90% of hash power signals support for the upgrade, tap Root ready nodes will start enforcing the new rules. The difference lies in what happens if, when the year is up, minors have not signaled for activation. In the case of lot False, the activation simply expires like a regular MASF. At that point, Tap Root would not have activated and nodes continue to use the current Bitcoin protocol. Without Tap Root, a new activation period could then be scheduled, this time presumably using lot equals true. In the case of lot True, the activation wouldn't expire. Instead, like a USF or user activated soft fork, nodes in the final weeks of the activation period start rejecting blocks that don't signal for Tap Root activation. When only blocks that signal readiness for Tap Root are accepted, the activation threshold will necessarily be reached, assuming, of course, that taproot signaling blocks are mined at all. There is actually a little bit more nuance to this process because a small number of non signaling blocks would still be allowed. But that's a technical detail and not very important in the context of this article. The main argument in favor of Lot True is that Lot False would give minors a, quote, veto on the upgrade. They could block taproot activation by refusing to signal readiness, even when there is broad consensus for the upgrade. During the SegWit activation period, it appeared that this veto was being leveraged by minors in an attempt to influence bitcoin protocol development. Lot False proponents, however, argue that this veto isn't really a veto at all, since it can be overruled in the end, miners cannot block tap root activation because users can always upgrade to Lot True clients, even if they initially used Lot False. This can be done in two main ways. Either users switch to Lot True clients before the activation period is over, that is, before the end of the year, or, as already mentioned, they can wait until the activation period is over and schedule a new activation period. Proponents of Lottrew, however, point out that these two different options to overrule the veto could be another recipe for community conflict. If, say, six months into the activation period, minors haven't signaled support for the upgrade, one segment of users may prefer to deploy Lot True clients before the year is over, while another segment may prefer to wait until after the first activation period before deploying a new activation mechanism. This would essentially reintroduce the current debate between Lot False and Lot True, but this time, with only six months to resolve the issue. This is easily avoided, lot True proponents figure, by simply not giving minors a sort of veto in the first place. But there are arguments in favor of Lot False and against Lot True as well. For one, Lot False more closely resembles the activation mechanics of previous softwares, most of which rolled out fairly well while the SegWit upgrade wasn't as smooth. Lot False proponents argue this was due to exceptional circumstances of the scaling wars, which are now behind us. Some Lot True proponents, however, believe that Lot False might invite such circumstances again. Second, given that most mining pools have indicated support for the tap root upgrade, Lot False is likely to do the job without it ever coming to a timeout scenario. This makes Lot true unnecessary. Lot True proponents instead argue that stated intentions shouldn't be a factor in designing a technical upgrade mechanism, and that Lot True would best align incentives to ensure that minors indeed upgrade before the end of the year. Third, in the unlikely scenario that a problem with tap root is found, Lot False makes it easy to back out of the upgrade. Miners would simply refrain from signaling readiness, and the proposal would expire without requiring users to upgrade their software. Again, lot True proponents believe Taproot is well reviewed and shouldn't be up for activation in the first place if that weren't the case, and even if a problem is found, after all, it should be relatively easy to diffuse Taproot activation through technical means. Fourth, Lot True could feed into the perception that Bitcoin Core developers have the power to change the Bitcoin protocol. Since Lot True would, quote, guarantee tap root activation, their code would force this change of the protocol rules. This perception could attract unwanted attention towards developers. This perception would be mostly false. As also pointed out by proponents of Not True, in the end, users would need to voluntarily choose to adopt the new Bitcoin Core software. Developers can ship code, but they can't make users run it. Most Lot False proponents agree, but argue that the perception of developer power might be there regardless, and the perception alone might be harmful enough, even if wrong. But probably most importantly, the fifth argument for Lot False and against Lot True is that Lot True could in some scenarios result in an unstable network and perhaps even a split in the blockchain. This could lead to a loss of funds for users and miners and undermine trust in the Bitcoin project altogether. Lot True proponents, however, argue that it's the other way around, and Lot False in Bitcoin Core would represent the greater risk of this scenario unfolding. To understand this discrepancy, let's look at some scenarios. What ",

And I just mentioned the uncertainty at the beginning of this episode. I mentioned some of it at least, that some people thought the USF was a great success. Some people thought it was a reckless thing that happened. Yes. I think both are partly true. There's truth to all of it. Now we have a Softwork taproos that everyone seems to love. Users seem to like it, developers seem to like it, mine seem to like it, everyone likes it. The only thing we need to do is upgrade it. Now might be a very good opportunity to sort of clean up the mess from 2017 in a way agree on what softwares are exactly what is the best way to deploy a Softwork and then use that? Because that way it sort of becomes a template that we can use in more contentious times in the future when maybe there is another civil war going on or there's more flood being thrown at Bitcoin. We seem to be in calm waters right now. Maybe this is a really good time to do it right, which will help us moving into the future. While Speedy Trial, no one thinks this is actually the right way. It's sort of fine. We need something, so let's do it. But we might arguably it's arguably kicking the can of the really big discussion we need to have down the road. Yeah, maybe so. One scenario I could see is where the Speedy Trial goes through, activate successfully and the type of deployment goes through and everything is fine. Then I think that would remove that trauma and then the next software would be done and need nice and old traditional Lotus Falls Bib eight we'll release something and then several months later miners start signaling and it'll activate. And so maybe it's a way to get over the trauma. Yeah, maybe. You think this is a way to get over the post traumatic stress disorder. Just let everyone see that minors can actually activate. Yeah, it might be good to get rid of that tension because the downside of releasing regular say Lotus false mechanism is that it's going to be six months of hoping that miners are going to signal and then hopefully just two weeks and it's done right. But that six months where everybody is anticipating it. People are just going to go even crazier than they are now. Perhaps. So I guess it's a nice way to say let's get this trauma over with. But I think there are downsides for one thing. What if in the next six months we find a bug in taboo because we have six months to think about something that is already we can software.

          "text": "Speedy trial. And I find this argument quite compelling, actually, which is that we came out of 2017 with a lot of uncertainty. And I just mentioned the uncertainty at the beginning of this episode. I mentioned some of it at least, that some people thought the USF was a great success. Some people thought it was a reckless thing that happened. Yes. I think both are partly true. There's truth to all of it. Now we have a Softwork taproos that everyone seems to love. Users seem to like it, developers seem to like it, mine seem to like it, everyone likes it. The only thing we need to do is upgrade it. Now might be a very good opportunity to sort of clean up the mess from 2017 in a way agree on what softwares are exactly what is the best way to deploy a Softwork and then use that? Because that way it sort of becomes a template that we can use in more contentious times in the future when maybe there is another civil war going on or there's more flood being thrown at Bitcoin. We seem to be in calm waters right now. Maybe this is a really good time to do it right, which will help us moving into the future. While Speedy Trial, no one thinks this is actually the right way. It's sort of fine. We need something, so let's do it. But we might arguably it's arguably kicking the can of the really big discussion we need to have down the road. Yeah, maybe so. One scenario I could see is where the Speedy Trial goes through, activate successfully and the type of deployment goes through and everything is fine. Then I think that would remove that trauma and then the next software would be done and need nice and old traditional Lotus Falls Bib eight we'll release something and then several months later miners start signaling and it'll activate. And so maybe it's a way to get over the trauma. Yeah, maybe. You think this is a way to get over the post traumatic stress disorder. Just let everyone see that minors can actually activate. Yeah, it might be good to get rid of that tension because the downside of releasing regular say Lotus false mechanism is that it's going to be six months of hoping that miners are going to signal and then hopefully just two weeks and it's done right. But that six months where everybody is anticipating it. People are just going to go even crazier than they are now. Perhaps. So I guess it's a nice way to say let's get this trauma over with. But I think there are downsides for one thing. What if in the next six months we find a bug in taboo because we have six months to think about something that is already we can software. Out if that is a bug that. Can be fixed in the software. Yes, I think any Tabu you can just burn that type of. Yeah, I guess you could add a software that says no version one addresses. Yes, exactly.

All right, so maybe I should explain what that is, because this is one of the really nice things about store signatures that we're eventually going to get, hopefully. So what is it? Cross input signature aggregation is the ability to aggregate signatures. Now, what does that mean? Right now, when you do a multi SIG and you have like two of three or something like that, you have to have two separate signatures, each one being like 70 bytes or something like that. With Schnor, what you can do is you can have a taprootry of each of two of two of those keys. And what you do is whichever path you end up taking, that's the one that you use. And you only see one signature because the signature is going to be aggregated and the pub keys can be aggregated. So you see one Pub key and one signature. Now, what does cross input means? So say you're spending from five inputs. Even with Snore, what you end up doing is you have to have at least one signature and one pubkey per input. And that kind of sucks because you can also aggregate those. And that's, I think where we're headed. And among other things, that means that if you have like 20 inputs, you only still need one signature. So you can amortize the cost of various of that block space over lots and lots of inputs, which means that there's now an incentive to coin join. You can have lots of people get into this coin join, and when you do, you essentially make it so that every single person gets to be a part of a large transaction. And that means you're saving some blocks space because you only have one signature for this one giant transaction and you have the ability to coin join, like sort of. Naturally, every exchange is going to want to do this because it would be in the best interests of their customers to pay less fees and so on, and I imagine they'll be the ones running these giant coin joins to make that happen.

And there are plenty of people who say that the status quo right now is fine and could work into the future, and there's nothing wrong with them representing that, period. Sorry. That opinion, my personal contention would be like we have to continue going through this process because there's no way to know if you're at the end of needing to upgrade Bitcoin. Therefore, it's better if the participants in Bitcoin are more educated about that, because Aaron said it's not this like theoretical thing. It is on some level. But at the end of the day, it's like you have to decide which Bitcoins to accept and the actual vehicle for you to do that is the software. So I think going through this process, even if it is actively trying to destabilize and not have a process, is somewhat of a process, and that process, I think is good for Bitcoin. We should continue going down there. But maybe CTD is just not interesting enough for everyone to kind of upgrade their software and maybe it fails on that basis, or maybe it's rolled in with other proposals. Right. So sometimes what's happened is that at Taproot, it wasn't just Taffwood, it was Taproot and Shore signatures. Right. So there were multiple proposals that kind of came together, and both of those are upgraded at once. There's a lot of things that could happen here. I think it's way too early to tell whether Ops CTV would go in by itself, whether it would fail, whether it be Bachelor things. Certainly what you can say right now is that people are talking about it. I think that's good. I think it's good for people to be involved in the technical workings of Bitcoin and to understand how Bitcoin functions, because there are tons of unanswered questions here. Right. As me and Aaron have just been talking, there's a lot about Bitcoin governance theory and how it functions that just, you know, we probably won't know the full answers for very long time. And we as Bitcoiners who want to see Bitcoin succeed in the future. The more knowledge we have of that process, I would argue the more secure Bitcoin is. Right. Because ultimately you don't want to trust anyone. That's the core ethos. So how do you not trust anyone? Well, you're as informed as possible. That's the best defense you have. Yeah. But even if you're not so I think one of the nice things about Bitcoin is that the incentives really do align very well. The incentives, the economics, the game theory. That's one of the reasons we do Softworks in the first place. It's better to not kick anyone off of the network. It's better if we make an upgrade and UQ can still pay me and I can pay you even if I am upgraded and you're not yet. So there's a very strong incentive that basically the people that care and the miners, like I mentioned, they have a very strong incentive to keep you who don't understand or don't care to still keep you on the network. So in that sense, I'm not really concerned even if people don't want to learn about this or even if because incentives are so strong to keep you on the network. That said, it would be even better if everyone does learn about it and does potentially upgrade to a new client if they feel that better represents their values or if that better represents the way they want to see Bitcoin develop or grow.

      "text": "like a software period, I really like to run two separate nodes. One with the old client and one with the new client. So that in the case of a split or basically worst case scenario, I just shut the wrong one down. So let's say we get all. UASF up in here and I'm like gung ho about this and it's like, okay, the pressure is really on and we have to decide either move forward with Tap route or not. And it's like 50 50 or 60 40 or something like that and things are kind of leaning towards the Tap root way, well then I'm going to shut my other one down. We're just going to go for it. We got a couple of weeks. Let's just push crazy hard and get everybody on board or something. I don't know, just a made up scenario. Probably if it was that close, I'd probably just roll back as opposed to push forward. But nonetheless, there might be a scenario where we want to just go full on activation. Probably more like if it's like 87% and we haven't hit the 90% threshold, it's like, all right, just man up, let's just do this. Whoever is not upgrading at this point, it's been two years, it's October of 2022 and we're just getting right around the corner. It's like, if that 3%, that extra 3% doesn't want to upgrade Tap route, well then they had their chance. All the old nodes are safe. It's not like people are going to get kicked off of bitcoin if they're not using Tap root or something. It's just miners need to validate the new rules in order to stay active and that's what we want. The consensus on the rules needs to be the same. So in that case we move forward. But if not, just shut your Taproot client off, right? If you are in the more realistic situation where you have 50 50 or 40% towards Taproot or something like that, and it's real hairy and it looks like there's going to be a coin split, you can really easily just shut down the relevant note that you need to, or just catch back up, resync the other node. You haven't lost that client and you can just catch back up with the bitcoin zero point 21.0, the pre Taproot client or whatever it is. Well, then you basically protected yourself from whatever potential problems that new version has caused or could cause without forcing yourself to start from scratch and boot up a new node in two or three days. You can basically in 30 minutes to an hour or whatever, get back right in line with the chain tip and work from there. That's at least what I do. I got a lot of extra computers lying around, so it's very easy for me. But it's an added barrier to the potentiality of a bug, the potentiality of a fork, whatever it is, that you can easily just drop one node and switch to another that are running separate pieces of software that are going to be less the likelihood of them both being susceptible to the same problem. Obviously, most specifically in the case of a softwork where only one of them is running the software just makes it easier. And when you're ready to switch over to one, when it looks like everything's ready to go and we're full on Tap root, we had a 90% threshold to shut that up and down or upgraded or whatever it is. Anyway, maybe that's overly cautious or ridiculous because now I've got two nodes signaling two different things on the network. But I'm not a minor, so it doesn't really matter in my context. I just want to be able to follow what the majority of miners do, as long as it's what it's in line with what I think the rules of Bitcoin are. Like in the case of validating a false tap root transaction or whatever, I want to go with my tap root client because that broke the rules, right? And at the end of the day, the rules are about the whole purpose of the code, is to maintain and preserve the rules, the ownership, the philosophy, or the purpose, I guess you could say, of Bitcoin. And sometimes that has to be enforced, in a sense, with the social sphere, with the decision of which node to run. Inevitably, there's always the possibility of a bug. And that's kind of like I don't know, it's like a buffer in my mind of my own ability to choose or direct around some potential problem like that. Or fork has no purpose and never needed to happen, and it was just kind of a mistake of competing clients like this sort of situation. So I got to admit, after kind of getting the details, the idea of a coin fork seems less and less likely in my opinion. The risks and disagreements I feel like have really been kind of a little bit blown out of proportion. Everybody still got PTSD from the USF. And the whole block size of war situation, so maybe it's reasonable in certain context. And like I've said in the past, I'm more of a just kind of a lot true kind of guy, particularly if we have a long time out, like a long period to actually get that done, which in this case, Aaron Vinwardham actually said, you have three months to sort that out, and you're talking about from August to November when activation can happen on the alternative client. But technically it's a lot longer than that, because that's assuming that that client gets a 90% threshold, which if it doesn't, it doesn't actually ever kick in until November of 2022 in the case of never reaching 90%. So it's quite a bit longer than three months, unless, of course, there is solid consensus on tap root and a high minor adoption, which in that case, it seems pretty unlikely that that doesn't happen prior to August, right? Like the speedy trial will probably succeed if that's the case. Now, the only scenario that Aaron breaks down here, which I think is kind of inaccurate, about when the risk of this is and maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Aaron has probably done more work on it, so maybe I would defer to him until I kind of dig into it a little bit more. But it says it's this paragraph here less. Obviously a majority of miners could at any time after the speedy trial signaling period, but before the end of the bitcoin tap Root signaling period, false signal. They could signal readiness without actually planning to enforce the Tap Root rules. This wouldn't in itself make bitcoin tap Root and bitcoin core nodes incompatible, but they would have a different interpretation of the bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin tap Root would enforce tap Root rules while bitcoin core would not. This could in turn split the network if an invalid tap Root transaction is mined. Now I'm going to stop right there because it seems like it's not really about that period specifically. So after the speedy trial signaling period ends, but before the bitcoin tap Root signaling period ends, they could false signal and this would activate tap Root. Well, technically this could happen before that as well during the speedy trial. Again, the signaling doesn't necessarily mean you are ready to enforce tap Root. It is still just signaling. There's no way to prove exactly that a miner has upgraded and is enforcing taproot. It's all just signaling mechanisms so they could false signal to get the speedy trial to activate and then still not actually enforce the tap Root rules. So this kind of feels like more of a soft forked in general problem and would always come about if a minor was signaling for tap Root but then not enforcing the rules. Technically we could still have 60% of the miners not actually enforcing the segment rules and not know it. They're all just signaling for segment and signaling that they upgraded their clients to version, blah blah blah. But we don't know. We're not like auditing their computers or anything. Maybe they just lied and updated their signaling. And if someone tried to spin the segment output, maybe 50% of the nodes or 60% of the nodes don't even recognize that it's an invalid signature because they're actually running really old clients. Obviously this is ridiculously unlikely, but it could still be the case. Like we could signal all day and just lie about what we're signaling and therein lies caution, right? This sort of thing is always a potentiality so I don't quite see and maybe there's some dynamic that I'm not thinking about, like in the fact that lot equals true will basically activate it one way or the other. But it doesn't seem like that's actually any different in the period after the speedy trial and then before the end of the bitcoin tap Root signaling, then it is really just a problem period. Maybe there's like one little piece or dynamic that I'm not quite thinking about or taking into account. But it just seems like false signaling is just a problem with false signaling during a time where we're changing the consensus rules. And by that, obviously I don't mean a hard fork where we're changing the consensus rules. We're changing them in the sense that we are restricting them and adding in a tightening of the rules, aka softwork, backwards, compatible, all the caveat of all that good stuff. So it's interesting and after kind of digging into this and getting more specifics here, and I'm probably going to dive a little bit deeper now that like, I kind of know what the details are, but it seems like at this point, just do the zero point to 1.1 client. That's probably what I'm going to do. I'm just going to upgrade my main bitcoin node and potentially my umbrella when that client comes out. Maybe I'll wait on it again. It's an activation node, so I'll probably probably won't upgrade them both at once. But if it doesn't look like the speedy trial was going to hit in the three months, I don't know, it kind of feels like just sign right over to the VIP Eight client or the alternative client. I mean, they're both VIP Eight, but the lot equals true client and use that as a backup. Be ready to roll back or implement a different bitcoin core client if they get a release candidate out fast enough to account for the potential problems that could result if it activates within the next year and three months or whatever when we hit August, if it doesn't lock in, but I think it is going to lock in. I think activation for tap route is I really hope it's going to go smoothly. There does not seem to be as much of a debate about Tap route. All the debate that I have seen is about how to turn the damn switch on. So it feels like a no brainer to me. Just ",

          "text": "like a software period, I really like to run two separate nodes. One with the old client and one with the new client. So that in the case of a split or basically worst case scenario, I just shut the wrong one down. So let's say we get all. UASF up in here and I'm like gung ho about this and it's like, okay, the pressure is really on and we have to decide either move forward with Tap route or not. And it's like 50 50 or 60 40 or something like that and things are kind of leaning towards the Tap root way, well then I'm going to shut my other one down. We're just going to go for it. We got a couple of weeks. Let's just push crazy hard and get everybody on board or something. I don't know, just a made up scenario. Probably if it was that close, I'd probably just roll back as opposed to push forward. But nonetheless, there might be a scenario where we want to just go full on activation. Probably more like if it's like 87% and we haven't hit the 90% threshold, it's like, all right, just man up, let's just do this. Whoever is not upgrading at this point, it's been two years, it's October of 2022 and we're just getting right around the corner. It's like, if that 3%, that extra 3% doesn't want to upgrade Tap route, well then they had their chance. All the old nodes are safe. It's not like people are going to get kicked off of bitcoin if they're not using Tap root or something. It's just miners need to validate the new rules in order to stay active and that's what we want. The consensus on the rules needs to be the same. So in that case we move forward. But if not, just shut your Taproot client off, right? If you are in the more realistic situation where you have 50 50 or 40% towards Taproot or something like that, and it's real hairy and it looks like there's going to be a coin split, you can really easily just shut down the relevant note that you need to, or just catch back up, resync the other node. You haven't lost that client and you can just catch back up with the bitcoin zero point 21.0, the pre Taproot client or whatever it is. Well, then you basically protected yourself from whatever potential problems that new version has caused or could cause without forcing yourself to start from scratch and boot up a new node in two or three days. You can basically in 30 minutes to an hour or whatever, get back right in line with the chain tip and work from there. That's at least what I do. I got a lot of extra computers lying around, so it's very easy for me. But it's an added barrier to the potentiality of a bug, the potentiality of a fork, whatever it is, that you can easily just drop one node and switch to another that are running separate pieces of software that are going to be less the likelihood of them both being susceptible to the same problem. Obviously, most specifically in the case of a softwork where only one of them is running the software just makes it easier. And when you're ready to switch over to one, when it looks like everything's ready to go and we're full on Tap root, we had a 90% threshold to shut that up and down or upgraded or whatever it is. Anyway, maybe that's overly cautious or ridiculous because now I've got two nodes signaling two different things on the network. But I'm not a minor, so it doesn't really matter in my context. I just want to be able to follow what the majority of miners do, as long as it's what it's in line with what I think the rules of Bitcoin are. Like in the case of validating a false tap root transaction or whatever, I want to go with my tap root client because that broke the rules, right? And at the end of the day, the rules are about the whole purpose of the code, is to maintain and preserve the rules, the ownership, the philosophy, or the purpose, I guess you could say, of Bitcoin. And sometimes that has to be enforced, in a sense, with the social sphere, with the decision of which node to run. Inevitably, there's always the possibility of a bug. And that's kind of like I don't know, it's like a buffer in my mind of my own ability to choose or direct around some potential problem like that. Or fork has no purpose and never needed to happen, and it was just kind of a mistake of competing clients like this sort of situation. So I got to admit, after kind of getting the details, the idea of a coin fork seems less and less likely in my opinion. The risks and disagreements I feel like have really been kind of a little bit blown out of proportion. Everybody still got PTSD from the USF. And the whole block size of war situation, so maybe it's reasonable in certain context. And like I've said in the past, I'm more of a just kind of a lot true kind of guy, particularly if we have a long time out, like a long period to actually get that done, which in this case, Aaron Vinwardham actually said, you have three months to sort that out, and you're talking about from August to November when activation can happen on the alternative client. But technically it's a lot longer than that, because that's assuming that that client gets a 90% threshold, which if it doesn't, it doesn't actually ever kick in until November of 2022 in the case of never reaching 90%. So it's quite a bit longer than three months, unless, of course, there is solid consensus on tap root and a high minor adoption, which in that case, it seems pretty unlikely that that doesn't happen prior to August, right? Like the speedy trial will probably succeed if that's the case. Now, the only scenario that Aaron breaks down here, which I think is kind of inaccurate, about when the risk of this is and maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Aaron has probably done more work on it, so maybe I would defer to him until I kind of dig into it a little bit more. But it says it's this paragraph here less. Obviously a majority of miners could at any time after the speedy trial signaling period, but before the end of the bitcoin tap Root signaling period, false signal. They could signal readiness without actually planning to enforce the Tap Root rules. This wouldn't in itself make bitcoin tap Root and bitcoin core nodes incompatible, but they would have a different interpretation of the bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin tap Root would enforce tap Root rules while bitcoin core would not. This could in turn split the network if an invalid tap Root transaction is mined. Now I'm going to stop right there because it seems like it's not really about that period specifically. So after the speedy trial signaling period ends, but before the bitcoin tap Root signaling period ends, they could false signal and this would activate tap Root. Well, technically this could happen before that as well during the speedy trial. Again, the signaling doesn't necessarily mean you are ready to enforce tap Root. It is still just signaling. There's no way to prove exactly that a miner has upgraded and is enforcing taproot. It's all just signaling mechanisms so they could false signal to get the speedy trial to activate and then still not actually enforce the tap Root rules. So this kind of feels like more of a soft forked in general problem and would always come about if a minor was signaling for tap Root but then not enforcing the rules. Technically we could still have 60% of the miners not actually enforcing the segment rules and not know it. They're all just signaling for segment and signaling that they upgraded their clients to version, blah blah blah. But we don't know. We're not like auditing their computers or anything. Maybe they just lied and updated their signaling. And if someone tried to spin the segment output, maybe 50% of the nodes or 60% of the nodes don't even recognize that it's an invalid signature because they're actually running really old clients. Obviously this is ridiculously unlikely, but it could still be the case. Like we could signal all day and just lie about what we're signaling and therein lies caution, right? This sort of thing is always a potentiality so I don't quite see and maybe there's some dynamic that I'm not thinking about, like in the fact that lot equals true will basically activate it one way or the other. But it doesn't seem like that's actually any different in the period after the speedy trial and then before the end of the bitcoin tap Root signaling, then it is really just a problem period. Maybe there's like one little piece or dynamic that I'm not quite thinking about or taking into account. But it just seems like false signaling is just a problem with false signaling during a time where we're changing the consensus rules. And by that, obviously I don't mean a hard fork where we're changing the consensus rules. We're changing them in the sense that we are restricting them and adding in a tightening of the rules, aka softwork, backwards, compatible, all the caveat of all that good stuff. So it's interesting and after kind of digging into this and getting more specifics here, and I'm probably going to dive a little bit deeper now that like, I kind of know what the details are, but it seems like at this point, just do the zero point to 1.1 client. That's probably what I'm going to do. I'm just going to upgrade my main bitcoin node and potentially my umbrella when that client comes out. Maybe I'll wait on it again. It's an activation node, so I'll probably probably won't upgrade them both at once. But if it doesn't look like the speedy trial was going to hit in the three months, I don't know, it kind of feels like just sign right over to the VIP Eight client or the alternative client.

      "text": "think about contrast, sort of like core development to general development or other development jobs that you've had. What strikes you as very different? I mean, we've talked about some of them, but do you see the results being different? Do you see the goals being different? What strikes you as the most different between sort of like the traditional development process and what's going on in Core? I haven't really done any other open source stuff really. Well, not even open source, but like at a company or something. Yeah. Well, what I mean is, like, I don't know if it's big Concor in particular or if it's open source development in particular. So it can be a bit vague there. But the fact that you don't have a plan, a collective plan, makes it it's an interesting dynamic where you have development going in different directions and people are working on different things, sometimes conflicting things. For example, the soon to be probably infamous, the sign message upgrade that I've been proposing, and it's been going through many iterations. I brought code for it a while back, and then the wallet code in the Concord just completely changed. And I was like, I don't even know how to rewrite this code to work with the new code. And I basically just closed the pull request and figured out come back to it when the wallet changes are done and just redo it. So I guess one part of different from working as a company is you have a Bitcoin Core is kind of like a living organism. It doesn't always go in the direction you want it to, even though it's probably a good direction it's going in. So you have this dynamic where it can be anti productive to you, even though it's productive to the Concor code base itself. It sounds almost like decentralization or something like that. Everyone's kind of doing their own thing, but there's like, order that emerges sort of naturally and it might not be the order that you were thinking. Yeah, right. Yeah. A lot of people like it's interesting because people point to people court and say, these guys are controlling Bitcoin. And I'm like, who do you mean exactly when you see these guys? Because I sure as hell does not. I do not control Bitcoin. Let me tell you how much. So if I'm a Bitcoin developer, I've been a Bitcoin developer for a while now. If I'm not controlling because who are you talking about? Are you talking about the maintainers? If a maintainer went in and merged something that people were not thoroughly happy about, then people would be like whining and yelling and being all up. People are really, they take it seriously. Right. And they're waiting for something like that to happen so they can yell and point fingers. Especially the people who don't like Beef and Core are probably just waiting for an opportunity to point something out like that. But because it's not happening and it's never going to happen, they're just going to sit there and wait. Essentially what I mean is Becomour does not control Bitcoin because nobody controls big Encore, right? Yeah. So even though Bitcoin Core tends to set the standard for what Beacon does, none of the individual developers in Bitcoin, Core has any say really in the direction is taking people propose stuff and then people shoot it down. And that happens all the time. Right. Even with the most Federated core developers. Yeah. I mean, I will never forget when I was in San Francisco and I was talking to Peter Willy and he started talking about this idea he had. And I was like, completely new to Bitcoin. And I said, well, wait, doesn't that go against the idea that the payee pays the transaction fees? When you make an address, the address is encoded so that no matter how complex your address is, the sender doesn't have to pay for your complexity. Right. In your address. And he looked at me, he's like, oh, yeah, you're right. And then he just dropped it. And that to me was like, I was like, wait, did I just what, kill something? Yes. That kind of stuff stuck with me. Like if a newbie can come up to Peter Willy and shoot down his idea like that. Peter Willy being the guy who invented Taproot and most of Segregate and the modern Bitcoin is basically mostly his ideas, then it's not controlled by anybody because random person can just point out an issue and then everyone respects that. And as long as there are no issues, what's the problem? Right. Yeah. And he's had a lot of different ideas. I don't think a lot of people know just like how many ideas he has. And you go to these, like the Cordev meetings that you and I have been to and he'll discuss something and it's like, what? Yeah, this is Bit 150 or something like that. Right. I didn't even know about this. We can make the encryption secure. So here's the protocol that I'm thinking. And it's like somebody will point out some flaw in it. It's like, okay. And then we might need to change that to this or whatever. And it's like, wow, this is like such a fringe part of Bitcoin. But he put so much thought into it. Yeah, I know. I remember Ted, who was part of the Lightning network. Yeah. He wrote the original Lightning paper. Yeah. I was talking to him and he was saying like, yeah, I'm kind of waiting for Peter Willy to finish his optimizations on the Bass 32 stuff. We're just waiting for it to finish. We can start using it all like optimizing and optimizing. And everyone said, yeah, whenever you're done, just send it over. Everyone was more. They just wanted to use it. And Peter was like, wait, no, we have to be perfect. Of course, he updated again. Right. But to touch on what you were saying, a lot of people don't know about it or forgot about it. But there's an entirely different proposal from Tap Route by Mark Freedenbar to dortmreat. No, what was it called? Mast Merclized, mass, insects, trees. And the proposal, I was kind of asked to push it forward. And it was a proposal that it was very thorough and very thought out and it could potentially do a lot of really cool things. And that proposal, personally, I think Mark disagrees with me. But I think that proposal is now completely obsolete by Taproot because you have a tap script. Right. Which is awesome. That's the best. Yeah, it is math. It is exactly math. But if you look at Tap Root, you also realize the tabloid is like ten different proposals that have been iterated and discarded and reiterated. There was something called graph roots. There was something called Groot. I think Groot and graphs are the same. I don't know. Anyway, there was a lot of proposals going back and forth. A bunch of people were just iterating. And iterating on this basic idea that Greg Maxwell threw on the main list. So Taproot people say Taproot, but what they're really saying is this big bundle of things. Yeah. So many things. Yes. And a lot of them were discarded or reiterated or replaced. So you only see the stuff that goes in. But you don't realize that there's a lot of stuff that doesn't go in. I mean, recently that's been going around is the drive change stuff, the big 300 stuff that's also, like, the author is insisting on there being favoritism or something, I think. But in reality, it's just what I mentioned earlier. Like, the whole people are harsh and straightforward and they can be straight out rude sometimes because they just want to cut to the core and they don't compromise. It's like, yeah, well, this guy's nice. So let's compromise and put this thing and that's going to compromise the entire security of a several billion trillion dollar network if you don't do that. So I think you have to have the mindset of openness and humility and tried to advocate for your stuff and. Be willing to change it. Right. This is what you're bringing up about Taproot. It went through many iterations with a lot of review. I remember seeing the Pub key for Schnor signatures using like, I think it was going to be odd versus no, it was going to be like the one that is a square root and one isn't. Instead they changed it to odd, even stuff like that. There's so many iterations before it actually got in. I'm not seeing anything like that with bit 300 with drive chains or something. It's an interesting idea, but there's no real iteration or review or, hey, this might be a problem. This might be a problem. And like the author addressing it, that doesn't seem to be happening there. Yeah. From what I understand, I think he's working on the proposal still, and I'm just going to keep working on it. And I respect that. I can see that. But I don't think it's okay. It's the attacks on the cordevs and stuff. I don't think that's necessary. I think that's a mistake. You don't have to do that because the Cordes are not a group of people in the first place. Like they're scattered all over the world. They have different views. They're libertarians, Liberals, Socialists, communists. Everything is just mixed in there. And everyone has conflicting views. We probably all hate each other. If we met in person and start talking about outside of Bitcoin because we are all into Bitcoin, we just kind of like hanging with each other. So you kind of have to understand that part. And I think that's a hard thing to understand. Apparently people are concerned about that. They're kind of used to a development process that's very different, it seems. Yes. They're used to sort of like what you are describing where you have a plan and you have a road map and you have a project manager and you have deadlines and all that. This is how all coins are developed. It seems like right. Now I'm right. You have to get this feature because it's part of our narrative or something like that. Instead, it's just sort of like this very free flowing, decentralized process where, sorry, you just didn't get the things that were required to get there. And if you're not willing to fix these issues that we found, then, sorry, it's just not getting in. Yeah. That's very hard for a lot of people. And like you were saying, it requires a certain type of person. Yeah. Well, I think even worse, even harder to deal with is the Greg Maxwell described it as the Thunder silence. And what it is is people don't agree with your proposal, but they're not ready to fight about it. They just ignore it. Right. They don't respond, they don't react. And so when you propose something and then there's like silence and then you don't know if that means that people don't agree with it or if it means that people don't care, or if it means that it's hard to gauge what the sentiment is when you have that under assignment. Yeah, right. So I think that's also a big issue. And I think that may be one of the drive chain things. I'm not sure because I wasn't really paying attention to what that was discussed in the first place the first time. But I mean, yeah, like being ignored can also make you kind of like bumped out as well. Yeah. It's a very discouraging endeavor in some ways, despite the people being very nice and everything else. It's like, okay, no one seems at all interested. It just might be that your idea kind of sucks. Right. People don't want to tell you that it sucks. And also the thing that is unique about Bitcoin, I think, is that every single person, when they get into Bitcoin, they're like, I'm new to Bitcoin. I know how to solve this. And then they come with the solution to increase the block size or to increase make blocks go faster or something like that. And they propose it. And then they send out this email to the mailing list like, hey, Bitcoin, 2 million transactions per second. And then you're like, not again, people going through this for years and years. And so some people are like, even today, they respond and gently describe why it's a bad idea or people coming to say, like, proof of work is really bad for the environment. Let's change it and make it. Let's just use this other thing, which is proof of work with lipstick on it. And someone just says, well, if you do that, you're going to ultimately get down to proof of work anyway. So I think a big issue that is unique to become probably is the fact that everyone is new knows exactly how to solve it, and they all go in and they go through these steps. Right. Exactly. Like Elon Musk went through these steps and he did it publicly on Twitter. He went through the steps, too. And just like everyone else did, everyone goes through the steps. Maybe there are some people who are like exceptions, but generally, at least I did. Well, these are people that are, I guess, confident enough to try to put in a pool request to core or at least email the mailing list. I suspect that the people that aren't are the ones that are humble enough to recognize. Okay. I really can't fix Bitcoin and this is probably something someone's already thought of or something to that effect. Yeah, right. But it is interesting how many of those happen that they know, right? Yeah. Like the mailing list is like, you see this email coming back over and over again with different author names. Oh, ",

I didn't even know about this. We can make the encryption secure. So here's the protocol that I'm thinking. And it's like somebody will point out some flaw in it. It's like, okay. And then we might need to change that to this or whatever. And it's like, wow, this is like such a fringe part of Bitcoin. But he put so much thought into it. Yeah, I know. I remember Ted, who was part of the Lightning network. Yeah. He wrote the original Lightning paper. Yeah. I was talking to him and he was saying like, yeah, I'm kind of waiting for Peter Willy to finish his optimizations on the Bass 32 stuff. We're just waiting for it to finish. We can start using it all like optimizing and optimizing. And everyone said, yeah, whenever you're done, just send it over. Everyone was more. They just wanted to use it. And Peter was like, wait, no, we have to be perfect. Of course, he updated again. Right. But to touch on what you were saying, a lot of people don't know about it or forgot about it. But there's an entirely different proposal from Tap Route by Mark Freedenbar to dortmreat. No, what was it called? Mast Merclized, mass, insects, trees. And the proposal, I was kind of asked to push it forward. And it was a proposal that it was very thorough and very thought out and it could potentially do a lot of really cool things. And that proposal, personally, I think Mark disagrees with me. But I think that proposal is now completely obsolete by Taproot because you have a tap script. Right. Which is awesome. That's the best. Yeah, it is math. It is exactly math. But if you look at Tap Root, you also realize the tabloid is like ten different proposals that have been iterated and discarded and reiterated. There was something called graph roots. There was something called Groot. I think Groot and graphs are the same. I don't know. Anyway, there was a lot of proposals going back and forth. A bunch of people were just iterating. And iterating on this basic idea that Greg Maxwell threw on the main list. So Taproot people say Taproot, but what they're really saying is this big bundle of things. Yeah. So many things. Yes. And a lot of them were discarded or reiterated or replaced. So you only see the stuff that goes in. But you don't realize that there's a lot of stuff that doesn't go in. I mean, recently that's been going around is the drive change stuff, the big 300 stuff that's also, like, the author is insisting on there being favoritism or something, I think. But in reality, it's just what I mentioned earlier. Like, the whole people are harsh and straightforward and they can be straight out rude sometimes because they just want to cut to the core and they don't compromise. It's like, yeah, well, this guy's nice. So let's compromise and put this thing and that's going to compromise the entire security of a several billion trillion dollar network if you don't do that. So I think you have to have the mindset of openness and humility and tried to advocate for your stuff and. Be willing to change it. Right. This is what you're bringing up about Taproot. It went through many iterations with a lot of review. I remember seeing the Pub key for Schnor signatures using like, I think it was going to be odd versus no, it was going to be like the one that is a square root and one isn't. Instead they changed it to odd, even stuff like that. There's so many iterations before it actually got in. I'm not seeing anything like that with bit 300 with drive chains or something. It's an interesting idea, but there's no real iteration or review or, hey, this might be a problem. This might be a problem. And like the author addressing it, that doesn't seem to be happening there. Yeah. From what I understand, I think he's working on the proposal still, and I'm just going to keep working on it. And I respect that. I can see that. But I don't think it's okay. It's the attacks on the cordevs and stuff. I don't think that's necessary. I think that's a mistake. You don't have to do that because the Cordes are not a group of people in the first place. Like they're scattered all over the world. They have different views. They're libertarians, Liberals, Socialists, communists. Everything is just mixed in there. And everyone has conflicting views. We probably all hate each other. If we met in person and start talking about outside of Bitcoin because we are all into Bitcoin, we just kind of like hanging with each other. So you kind of have to understand that part. And I think that's a hard thing to understand. Apparently people are concerned about that. They're kind of used to a development process that's very different, it seems. Yes. They're used to sort of like what you are describing where you have a plan and you have a road map and you have a project manager and you have deadlines and all that. This is how all coins are developed. It seems like right. Now I'm right. You have to get this feature because it's part of our narrative or something like that. Instead, it's just sort of like this very free flowing, decentralized process where, sorry, you just didn't get the things that were required to get there. And if you're not willing to fix these issues that we found, then, sorry, it's just not getting in. Yeah. That's very hard for a lot of people. And like you were saying, it requires a certain type of person. Yeah. Well, I think even worse, even harder to deal with is the Greg Maxwell described it as the Thunder silence. And what it is is people don't agree with your proposal, but they're not ready to fight about it. They just ignore it. Right. They don't respond, they don't react. And so when you propose something and then there's like silence and then you don't know if that means that people don't agree with it or if it means that people don't care, or if it means that it's hard to gauge what the sentiment is when you have that under assignment. Yeah, right. So I think that's also a big issue. And I think that may be one of the drive chain things. I'm not sure because I wasn't really paying attention to what that was discussed in the first place the first time. But I mean, yeah, like being ignored can also make you kind of like bumped out as well. Yeah. It's a very discouraging endeavor in some ways, despite the people being very nice and everything else. It's like, okay, no one seems at all interested. It just might be that your idea kind of sucks. Right. People don't want to tell you that it sucks. And also the thing that is unique about Bitcoin, I think, is that every single person, when they get into Bitcoin, they're like, I'm new to Bitcoin. I know how to solve this. And then they come with the solution to increase the block size or to increase make blocks go faster or something like that. And they propose it. And then they send out this email to the mailing list like, hey, Bitcoin, 2 million transactions per second. And then you're like, not again, people going through this for years and years. And so some people are like, even today, they respond and gently describe why it's a bad idea or people coming to say, like, proof of work is really bad for the environment. Let's change it and make it. Let's just use this other thing, which is proof of work with lipstick on it. And someone just says, well, if you do that, you're going to ultimately get down to proof of work anyway. So I think a big issue that is unique to become probably is the fact that everyone is new knows exactly how to solve it, and they all go in and they go through these steps. Right. Exactly. Like Elon Musk went through these steps and he did it publicly on Twitter. He went through the steps, too. And just like everyone else did, everyone goes through the steps. Maybe there are some people who are like exceptions, but generally, at least I did. Well, these are people that are, I guess, confident enough to try to put in a pool request to core or at least email the mailing list. I suspect that the people that aren't are the ones that are humble enough to recognize. Okay. I really can't fix Bitcoin and this is probably something someone's already thought of or something to that effect. Yeah, right. But it is interesting how many of those happen that they know, right? Yeah. Like the mailing list is like, you see this email coming back over and over again with different author names. Oh, ",

      "text": "thesis or theory that things like the Lightning Network or Tarot will end up actually serving as some sort of tailwind, similar to maybe cloud computing coming out of the 2008 global financial crisis. First, let's start with how do you view Lightning and Tarot? And then why do you think that they could serve as this kind of tail and coming out as bear market? So when we're looking at the space of startups, we're looking at the startup ecosystem, we really want to understand the dynamics that exist around it, to allow companies to thrive and to really build large enterprise to have a cultural impact. And so ahead of Stillmark even launching, what was important, the trigger events for Stillmark to launch as a Bitcoin focus fund was the advancement of segmented on bitcoin core. And as you know, and probably most of your audience knows, that one of the ramifications of Segwayt was that we could have this much more robust Lightning Network bitcoins payment network, grow on top of bitcoin. And so still mark launched right after we saw that SegWit would gain adoption and integration with first explorer apps. Now, the same opportunity, I think, exists with Tarot. So Tarot is the new protocol introduced by Lightning Labs, developed innovated by Lalu, otherwise known as roast beef. And what Taro does is it allows for assets, digital assets, to be traded on the Lightning Network. So peer to peer, and what I'm most excited about is seeing digital dollars on Lightning Network. And I think it's been we've all been waiting to see Tether on Lightning or Tether with the capability to be traded instantly and nearly for free. And now, by the end of this year, I believe, I expect that that will be possible via Tarot. Now, this sort of links to some of the adoption activity that we saw in 2021, right, where we saw Lightning Network help introduce bitcoin in emerging markets. And what really captured the headlines, of course, in 2021 was El Salvador adopting bitcoin. All of that economic activity happened on top of Lightning Network. And so it was a chance to do two really critical things. First it tested Lightning Network at scale. Could Lightning Network work when it wasn't just a bunch of bitcoin? Or is sending when it wasn't just speaking tech to tech, when real world people that weren't thinking about bitcoin 24/7 were using it? And the answer was a resounding yes. It worked beautifully at scale. The second opportunity that we had from El Salvador's launch of bitcoin was to actually get feedback through adoption, through real world adoption. And so some of that feedback was, of course, that Lightning Network was a really valuable tool, especially for people that were under bank. But beyond that, what we heard was that bitcoin's volatility right now is hard to handle. So if you are making $400 a month, if your expenses range between $390 a month and $410 to handle bitcoin volatility is really difficult. It's hard to keep your family safe and well resourced. And so what Taro does is it responds to that. It allows you to use Lightning network to use bitcoin, really while not being exposed to bitcoin's volatility. And that makes sense for a lot of lower socioeconomic status populations. Talk to me more ",

          "text": "thesis or theory that things like the Lightning Network or Tarot will end up actually serving as some sort of tailwind, similar to maybe cloud computing coming out of the 2008 global financial crisis. First, let's start with how do you view Lightning and Tarot? And then why do you think that they could serve as this kind of tail and coming out as bear market? So when we're looking at the space of startups, we're looking at the startup ecosystem, we really want to understand the dynamics that exist around it, to allow companies to thrive and to really build large enterprise to have a cultural impact. And so ahead of Stillmark even launching, what was important, the trigger events for Stillmark to launch as a Bitcoin focus fund was the advancement of segmented on bitcoin core. And as you know, and probably most of your audience knows, that one of the ramifications of Segwayt was that we could have this much more robust Lightning Network bitcoins payment network, grow on top of bitcoin. And so still mark launched right after we saw that SegWit would gain adoption and integration with first explorer apps. Now, the same opportunity, I think, exists with Tarot. So Tarot is the new protocol introduced by Lightning Labs, developed innovated by Lalu, otherwise known as roast beef. And what Taro does is it allows for assets, digital assets, to be traded on the Lightning Network. So peer to peer, and what I'm most excited about is seeing digital dollars on Lightning Network. And I think it's been we've all been waiting to see Tether on Lightning or Tether with the capability to be traded instantly and nearly for free. And now, by the end of this year, I believe, I expect that that will be possible via Tarot. Now, this sort of links to some of the adoption activity that we saw in 2021, right, where we saw Lightning Network help introduce bitcoin in emerging markets. And what really captured the headlines, of course, in 2021 was El Salvador adopting bitcoin. All of that economic activity happened on top of Lightning Network. And so it was a chance to do two really critical things. First it tested Lightning Network at scale. Could Lightning Network work when it wasn't just a bunch of bitcoin? Or is sending when it wasn't just speaking tech to tech, when real world people that weren't thinking about bitcoin 24/7 were using it? And the answer was a resounding yes. It worked beautifully at scale. The second opportunity that we had from El Salvador's launch of bitcoin was to actually get feedback through adoption, through real world adoption. And so some of that feedback was, of course, that Lightning Network was a really valuable tool, especially for people that were under bank. But beyond that, what we heard was that bitcoin's volatility right now is hard to handle. So if you are making $400 a month, if your expenses range between $390 a month and $410 to handle bitcoin volatility is really difficult. It's hard to keep your family safe and well resourced. And so what Taro does is it responds to that. It allows you to use Lightning network to use bitcoin, really while not being exposed to bitcoin's volatility. And that makes sense for a lot of lower socioeconomic status populations. Talk to me more ",

Okay, so we are focused on precede and seed, mostly from the core funds, and we often lead maybe about half of the investments we make. We're the lead investor, but we don't have to be. We can participate just to follow somebody else or join a larger syndicate. But the reason why we often leave is because the way we invest is that we're trying to stay close to protocol development both in Lightning and in Bitcoin. And then we form investment hypotheses about what we expect to see changes at the protocol level. And with those investment hypotheses, we go out and look for founders that we believe can execute and can really produce value. So that's why we often lead. We also do some Series A investments. For instance, we invested in Lightning Lab Series A, and then sometimes on occasion, we put together special funds for later stage investments. So that would be outside of the core fund. So we invest pretty agnostically. Our check size last year, I think the range was between the initial check size was between 250 kwh and maybe 4 million across these different sorts of vehicles. And we can be more flexible than that, too. We could write a smaller or larger check, but what's important on the venture site because of course, we're managing people's money is that we're really thoughtful about what the market opportunity is and to match the investments to the market opportunity, which is very different from the token space where you're sort of not constrained in that same way. So when we invest, we're thinking about two buckets and one we haven't touched on at all yet. So let me mention it. The first is just the simple introduction of Bitcoin's core value proposition, but to a broader audience. So Causa is a really good example of this, where multifig is just an inherent heart of Bitcoin, but hard for most people, everyone almost, to implement themselves sustainably and in a stress free way without using a beautiful tool like Causa. Our next investment, actually, which I think will close next week, conference week is similar to that. So it's just offering to people something that inherently exists in Bitcoin, but in a way that it's simple, where you don't have to be a core developer to access it, then the other bucket is what we've talked about through this conversation, which is sort of what can you do, what new sorts of businesses and value propositions are possible through this tech. I love that. I'm going to press you when you're on the news desk if the announcement has not come out yet of when we're going to hear this announcement next week. Excited for that. Curious. We've talked a lot about sort of what you guys are looking at right now. When did this shift and what did it shift from? What were you guys mainly looking at in the Bitcoin space to invest in, and when did that sort of stop being the priority? Well, the fund is newish. We started in 2019 and so we've been pretty consistent. Here's how we organized what we're looking at. So in 2017, segment was activated, and what my expectation was for that was that we'd see a realtor would be a catalyst to the launch of lightning apps and lightning infrastructure companies. And as we started to see evidence of that, that's when the funds launched. And so we knew in fund one that we wanted to be really focused on payments, on infrastructure and on lightning, but not to the exclusion of companies like Causa that are just offering Bitcoin to the masses. Really the benefit of the fullness of the benefit of Bitcoin to the masses. Now Taproot has been activated. And so what we're looking for, there is a broadening of what's possible in the payment space and I think a better service of emerging markets through more flexible definition of payments on lightning. And so that's all fund one stuff, but that will carry forward for future funds and our work in general. So really we're just trying to observe what's on the roadmap for these protocols and be reactive to what that means for innovation and use cases. Does that answer your question? Yes. No, it absolutely does. And I really appreciate you allowing me to ask sometimes some silly questions here. What can we do on that? Maybe let me extend it a little bit, because you saw an announcement a couple of weeks ago, I think that we had Bakash Singh joined the team at Stilmark, and he is a research engineer by training. So the reason why that sort of background is important is because once something like Taproot is activated, we continue our research. So we're really trying to dig in on what's possible, what the protocols allow to be developed, and we use that in two ways. One, to sort of be a good partner to our portfolio companies to support how they think about expanding what they do. But then also so that, like I said, we can form investment hypotheses and really beyond the frontier of backing founders that are making good use of the coin and lightning. And so that's sort of the work. It's research of the protocol and what's possible and then supporting founders accordingly. I ",

We had a few randos standing outside with signs essentially, like, trying to say, oh, DOJ is a better coin than bitcoin or whatever bullshit that they wanted to do. Jimmy, I'm kind of expecting you to go stand outside of consensus. Bitcoin is the only crypto. There's no second best, whatever you want to put on the side. But what would your sign be that you're going to hang out and hold it in front of consensus? Honestly, I'm actually speaking at consensus twice. So I'm speaking once tomorrow, at once on Saturday. And the deal that I made with them was, okay, I'm going to speak about bitcoin only, and I want to make sure that I communicate the message of bitcoin to these people. So my talk tomorrow is going to be about fees and what the outlook of that looks like with a bunch of other people. And on Saturday, I'm going to talk about taproot to a bitcoin only audience. At least that's what's supposed to happen. So I think my message would be something like that where, hey, guys, stop wasting your time on these timeshare presentations. Let's talk about bitcoin instead, because basically everything else is going to be timeshare presentation. Like, I will not hold it against you, and I will very proudly say, hey, I know that guy was circulating jimmy Stalin just interrupting one of these shit corner presentations. That's it. We don't have to talk more about consensus. Yes. I don't know, you know, my history with it. I had that famous thing going on before. I'm not opposed to doing stuff like that, and certainly I could go wear my black hat and all that, but I don't know. I don't know if that's something that they're really interested in at the moment. So, yeah, it is what it is. Fair enough. Before we dive ",

Even though it's behind this single UTXO and however many commitments there are and doesn't really relate to any of the other potential uses or anything like covenants or vaults. I just wanted to isolate this singular kind of what I think is a bad economic incentive introduced into the fee market. And I think it's an interesting idea. I think this is certainly something worth considering. I think it's worth considering on the idea of using any sort of commitment to future transactions that is essentially unbounded. I think it's important to consider any potential scaling option that it needs that symmetry of it can scale in the receiving sense and it can scale in the sending sense. There's not this huge asymmetry where one side, like, you get lots of scaling up front, quote unquote, but it has the cost of needing all of the space on the exact same amount of space later. That, in my opinion, is not scaling. That's dead. Like I said, I think the easiest way to frame, the most accurate way to frame what that actually is, is blockspace debt. Whereas something like, let's say tap route or whatever, like just the idea of p two Sh the user is still committing to, like we talked about in Taproof. It's just a good example because you can have an unlimited number of branches in your script and all this stuff because it's all just a hash tree going back to the public key. Well, what makes that different, what makes that not the same economic reversal of the economics is that the person who actually wants to execute a specific branch of it knows that's their branch and that's the one that they actually need to execute. And to do that, they don't need all of these other branches don't need to be unrolled. They're options, not exits, so to speak. There are exits that one can choose, but even if there's 10,000 exits, you're only going to use one of the exits. And then also in the case of going back to the p two Sh example is that again, it's the spender who pays, it not the receiver. So in a sense. CTV or using a commitment as opposed to a I received those coins and they are in my UTXO. Using the commitment is reversing the gain that we got from p two Sh in the sense that while P two Sh made it so that the person who wanted the restrictions is the person who's paying for the restrictions. Well. We're back in the opposite direction where the person who is committing to the restrictions is not paying for any of it. It's the person who redeems it from those restrictions that now has to pay for it. So that one extra step kind of throws the economics back in the opposite direction. So anyway, I think that's all I wanted to cover in this episode specifically. Like I said, I'm still not done digging through it. I am kind of in a yeah, I don't want this right now sort of situation. I think the idea of these commitments and stuff, like while there's plenty of amazing features that I think we can get from this, I want a very lengthy discussion on something that could is a primitive in the sense that Jeremy talks about. It really does have a lot of things that we don't quite know that could be great features and really great benefits. But I want to know in what way and how could these things be used? And it's something as well as all the other TX I don't even remember, but there's like multiple other commitment ideas or opcodes that would enable this same sort of thing that I think deserves an incredibly lengthy discussion and analysis and more people thinking how can I use this to cause a problem?

There's another large group in the bitcoin community who believe, no, this is exactly the idea of building kind of a digital economy on top of a decentralized ledger of the layer one of bitcoin. How do you think through the differences between those two arguments? And is there one right answer or is it something where certain people will need these other assets and then some people will just use bitcoin itself? Well, in the future, of course, we're hoping and aiming and working towards a bitcoin denominated world. So I think that we're all on the same page with that. I am certainly on that path. I'm hoping that we get there. Our work is in part targeted towards advancing bitcoin and bitcoin adoption. To that point, however, in the interim, we have to acknowledge that people have very different needs, while people of privilege and of great resource can use bitcoin and can frankly be mostly benefited by bitcoin's volatility because we're able to hold for a longer duration, that's not true of everyone. And so I think one of the things that Satoshi was very clear about in the early days was that bitcoin is meant to be for everyone in a very non judgmental way. So we can't go into an emerging market, for example, and say, like, hey, if you want to use this test, even though we're able to give it to you without forcing volatility on you, we're going to hold that back and we're going to make you live in a bitcoin denominated world. And it doesn't matter what that means in terms of your family's safety. I think that that breaks with bitcoin. And so I'm excited to see that we can have a broader user group by being responsive to some of the needs that have been observed. When we really go broad, when you. Start looking at tarot, talk me through kind of what needs to happen for it actually to become a reality. Like, what are the big milestones or kind of sequence of events here that people should be paying attention to to make sure that it's on track to actually become a reality. Sure. So what we want to see is this year tarot launch. And then after tarot launches, the next important sort of tipping point in terms of tarot's potential impact is, of course, the introduction of liquidity services. And so that will be sort of how the roadmap progresses. First, the protocol will be available, and then after that, liquidity services will be available. And as we know, liquidity services are maturing. And the intention of this is to allow people a less frictional experience of using lightning, with the ultimate goal that lightning as a protocol, just like bitcoin, eventually can sort of fade into the background of many people's experience so that you're not feeling like you're using a cool new tech. You're feeling like you're having a seamless experience of integrating Lightning or finance of payments into your day to day. And so that's the target that's aimed same as true for Tara. So I asked the audience for a ton of questions before we got started and there was frankly really sophisticated questions and I just want to kind of read them out and you just fire away with answers.

And so what you do is you do section by section, and those animals will become the land tools of that grass. And what they'll do is they'll eat the grass down to a certain level, but they won't uproot the grass because the root systems in the soil is what's very important.

It's going to say, hey, you're going to look back at history and you're going to see how we used to do it. This is the best thing for your health. This is the best thing for the soil, is the best thing for the land. It's the best thing for our nation, and it's definitely the best thing for Bitcoin. And ",

Where can people go to learn more about you and mempool? They can follow at Memphis on Twitter. They can follow Me. I'm Soft Simon on Twitter. They should go to Memphis Space for the main Memphis Space website. They can go to the Liquid Network website for the Liquid Explorer.

      "text": "about sort of the mess that DeFi has made. We last week had Anthony Scaramucci tried to talk to us about DeFi. I absolutely blocked him and would not allow that conversation to go further. And I think that this is a word that's being used as sort of like this tagline of no one really understands it, but people are using it. So I need to say it. What are you noticing in conversations you have with different companies and other investors around D Five in particular? I mean, I guess what I'm noticing, I don't think this is the answer you want, but I guess what I'm noticing is that folks are moving on from DeFi to be focused on NFCs and Bows. To be perfectly honest, DeFi is already sort of stale or like people have caught on to what it means and what it doesn't mean. But that said, Bitcoin is defy, of course, and we don't call it DeFi because we don't tend to use those sorts of flashy words, and we tend to try to be more accurate when we're describing Bitcoin, although I don't know that that's been helpful to us. I guess I leave that without judgment. So here's how we think about it. We're seeing altcoin spaces and protocols as an opportunity to learn about what people find valuable and what can gain sustainable traction. And so if in the DeFi space there was an element or value there that found a user base that was committed beyond the gambling proposition, then we want to understand it, we want to take lessons from it, and we want to see if there's founders that are going to be building it in the Bitcoin space. And so that's how still Mark approach D Five, and we would do the same thing with other trends as well. So I'll leave it at that. I'm hopeful that there are lessons that we can Port from CPI over into the Bitcoin space, but we're realistic when we look at that. So an example of what that means in practice is that we know that the adoption numbers are driven by a variety of things, including unsustainable trends. And so when we're looking at the number of people using defy and how they're using it, we're trying to actually understand what the drivers are versus having some sort of, like naive optimism that activity can be sustained, including if the regulatory arbitrage play fell apart. Does that make sense? Yes. I'm a little curious. Also, maybe this is just more common than a question, but when you say that the conversation around D Five is already getting stale, is there a staleness around the conversation on Bitcoin as well, or does that still have a lively conversation and a lively investment cycle going on? Well, I mean, I think that it's very lively. Let me go back to something that I was going to say in response to your second question, which is that one of the things that's exciting for 2022 in the Bitcoin field is that I believe we will start to see impact of taproof for the design space of Bitcoin, and I think that there will be a significant impact for payments. So I apologize for not directly answering your last question, but I just wanted to sort of lay the premise that there is a lot of the environment for Bitcoin is really dynamic this year, and the cause of that is some very technical and maybe hard to market changes that happened at the protocol level last year. That's part of what I'm looking forward to this year. Now the conversation around Bitcoin, Unfortunately, I don't think can ever get stale because Bitcoin is a target for a lot of these very well funded alternative protocols. And so I don't think, for instance, that the Energy Fund is going to die down this year. So that unfortunately, is not going to become stale. The rest of it will probably persist as well. And I think that's because while Bitcoin looks to take down the traditional financial system, the alternative protocols are aiming for Bitcoin. It's a different sort of ambition. Right. So Bitcoin is thinking really big, and other folks are just thinking about Bitcoin, and some even lower than that. Some are thinking about overtaking Ethereum, for instance. And so anyhow, I expect a lot of those fudge sort of seems to be repeated throughout the rest of this year and probably going forward after that, hopefully we'll get better at answering them. Well, I think you've made it very clear for a point that we all like to make, which is every other coin relies on Bitcoin for its marketing purposes, for its movement. And here we are yet again validating it with a mind much smarter than mine or Alex's or Chris's telling you exactly what we've been trying to tell you. Bitcoin is all that matters. You ",

      "text": "Root activation has been the subject of discussion since early 2020. Over the course of more than a year of discourse across the Bitcoin development mailing list, a dedicated IRC channel, and other discussion forums, a rough consensus appeared to have formed around using the Bitcoin improvement proposal eight BIP eight protocol to activate the soft fork. This would let minors activate the soft fork by signaling readiness until a timeout is reached. The final point of contention was around what should happen if not enough miners had signaled readiness when the timeout was reached, reflected in the lock in on timeout or Lot parameter. If Lot is set to false, Lot equals false. The upgrade simply expires at timeout, and a new activation mechanism can be considered. If lot is set to true, lot equals true. However, nodes will from that point on only accept signaling blocks and reject any non signaling blocks. Assuming that enough signaling blocks are mined in the first place, this guarantees activation. Without getting into all of the arguments on both sides of the Lot debate, these are summarized here, linked to the article as well as the audio in read. 502 will be available in the show notes. The disagreement appeared to be heading toward a deadlock. To avoid this, other proposals were considered like a flag day activation without hash power signaling. But perhaps more importantly, some Lot True proponents decided to launch a Lot True client a software fork of Bitcoin Core zero twenty one zero that would activate Taproot using Lot True, regardless of what the Bitcoin Core project would do, if anything. But in a bit of a lastminute twist, something of a compromise between different factions was found in a proposal called Speedy Trial. Speedy Trial would offer a quick three month window for miners to signal readiness for the upgrade. If miners would indeed signal readiness, Tap Root would activate later in the year. Some delay was built in to allow users enough time to upgrade as well. The Lot True proponents essentially accepted Speedy Trial because it was quick enough not to get in the way of their planned Lot True Activation, while Lot False proponents accepted Speedy Trial because it essentially is a Lot equals False implementation just on a shorter timeline. The solution wasn't really what most on either side of the debate had hoped for, but it was at least more broadly acceptable than anything else. That is, until the specifics around Speedy Trial were being finalized and both sides still ended up disagreeing on implementation details that would make Speedy Trial more or less compatible with the Lot True Client. The original philosophical divide between Lot True and not False, as well as the disagreement on speedy trials implementation details have now resulted in two different Tap Root activation clients.

          "text": "Root activation has been the subject of discussion since early 2020. Over the course of more than a year of discourse across the Bitcoin development mailing list, a dedicated IRC channel, and other discussion forums, a rough consensus appeared to have formed around using the Bitcoin improvement proposal eight BIP eight protocol to activate the soft fork. This would let minors activate the soft fork by signaling readiness until a timeout is reached. The final point of contention was around what should happen if not enough miners had signaled readiness when the timeout was reached, reflected in the lock in on timeout or Lot parameter. If Lot is set to false, Lot equals false. The upgrade simply expires at timeout, and a new activation mechanism can be considered. If lot is set to true, lot equals true. However, nodes will from that point on only accept signaling blocks and reject any non signaling blocks. Assuming that enough signaling blocks are mined in the first place, this guarantees activation. Without getting into all of the arguments on both sides of the Lot debate, these are summarized here, linked to the article as well as the audio in read. 502 will be available in the show notes. The disagreement appeared to be heading toward a deadlock. To avoid this, other proposals were considered like a flag day activation without hash power signaling. But perhaps more importantly, some Lot True proponents decided to launch a Lot True client a software fork of Bitcoin Core zero twenty one zero that would activate Taproot using Lot True, regardless of what the Bitcoin Core project would do, if anything. But in a bit of a lastminute twist, something of a compromise between different factions was found in a proposal called Speedy Trial. Speedy Trial would offer a quick three month window for miners to signal readiness for the upgrade. If miners would indeed signal readiness, Tap Root would activate later in the year. Some delay was built in to allow users enough time to upgrade as well. The Lot True proponents essentially accepted Speedy Trial because it was quick enough not to get in the way of their planned Lot True Activation, while Lot False proponents accepted Speedy Trial because it essentially is a Lot equals False implementation just on a shorter timeline. The solution wasn't really what most on either side of the debate had hoped for, but it was at least more broadly acceptable than anything else. That is, until the specifics around Speedy Trial were being finalized and both sides still ended up disagreeing on implementation details that would make Speedy Trial more or less compatible with the Lot True Client. The original philosophical divide between Lot True and not False, as well as the disagreement on speedy trials implementation details have now resulted in two different Tap Root activation clients.

      "text": "we get to some of the downsides of this proposal? Yes, some of the risks. I think the first one we kind of briefly mentioned because this thing is deployed quite quickly and because it's very clear that the activation of the rules is delayed, there is an incentive for miners to just signal rather than actually install the code. And then they could procrastinate on actually installing the software, and that's fine unless they procrastinate so long that they forget to actually enforce the rules. Yeah. Which sounds quite bad to me. Yeah, but that is bad. I agree. It's always possible for Minus to just signal and not actually enforce the rules. Right. This risk exists with any software deployment. Yes. Minus just fake signal. And that has happened in the past. We've seen fake signaling. It was a bit 66 software where we learned later that minors were fake signaling, in fact, because we saw big reorgs on the network. So that is definitely something we would want to avoid. Yeah. And I think we briefly explained this earlier, but we can explain it again, Bitcoin core. If you use that to create your blocks as a minor, there are some safety mechanisms in place to make sure that you do not create a block that is Invalid. However, if another miner creates a block that is Invalid, you will mine on top of it, and then you have a problem because the full notes that are enforcing Taproot will reject your block. And presumably most of the ecosystem, if the signaling thing works, will upgrade. But then you get into this whole very scary situation where you really hope that that's true and that not a massive part of the economy is too lazy to upgrade and you get a complete mess. Yes, correct. I think that the term we used we talked about is the idea of basically a troll. So you could have a troll user. Let's say I am a mean user and I'm going to create a transaction that is looks like a tap transaction, but is actually Invalid according to tapirt rules. Now the way that works, like the mechanism in Bitcoin to do so force is that you have this version number in your segment transaction. And so you say this is a segment version, one transaction and notes know that you're allowed to when you see a segment version, you don't know about, a higher version that you know about or tagworth version. Well, a separate version. Okay, sure, yeah. So current version of segment is version zero because we're nerds. And if you see a segward version transaction with one or higher, you assume that anybody can spend that money. That means that if somebody is spending from that address, you don't care. You don't consider the blocking valid as an old note, but a note that is aware of the version will check the rules. So what you could do as a troll is you could create a broken Snore signature. For example, you just take your Snore signature and you swap one bite. Then if that is seen by an old node, it says oh, this is separate version one. I don't know what that is. It's fine. Anybody could spend this. So I'm not going to check the signature. But the tap nodes will say hey, wait a minute, that's an Invalid signature. Therefore that's an Invalid block. We have a problem. Now there's a protection mechanism there that normal miners will not mine separate transactions that they don't know about. They will not mine segment version one if they're not upgraded. Isn't it also the case that regular notes will just not forward the transaction to other nodes? That's another safety mechanism, right? So there are two safety mechanisms. They're basically saying, hey, dear other note, I don't think you want to just give your money away. Or Alternatively, you're trying to do something super sophisticated that I don't understand to something called standardness. If you're doing something that is not standard, I'm not going to relay it. That is not a consensus rule and that's important. It means that you can compile your notes to relay those things and you can compile your minor to mine these things. But it's a food gun if you don't know what you're doing. But it's not against consensus. However, when a transaction is in a block, then you are dealing with consensus rules. And that again means that old nodes will look at it and say I don't care, I'm not going to check the signature because that's a higher version that I know about. But the notes that are upgraded will say hey wait a minute, this block contains a transaction that's Invalid. This block is Invalid. A troll user doesn't really send a chance to do much damage. No, because the transaction won't make it over the peer to peer network. And even if it does, it would only make it to minors. That will still reject it. Troll user probably can't do much harm. So our troll example of a user that swaps one bite in a schnoar signature, he tries to send this transaction, he sends it to a note that is upgraded. That note will say that's Invalid. Go away. I'm going to ban you now, or maybe not banned, but definitely gets angry. But if he sends it to a note that is not upgraded, that note will say, I don't know about this whole new Segregate version of yours. Go away. Don't send me this modern stuff. I'm like really old school send me old stuff. So the transaction doesn't go anywhere. But maybe somehow it does end up with the miner. Then the miner says, well, I'm not going to mine this thing that I don't know about. That's dangerous because I might lose all my money. However, you may have a troll miner. Now that would be very expensive trolling, but we have billionaires in this ecosystem. So if you mine a block that is Invalid, it's going to cost you a few hundred thousand euros. I think at the current prices, maybe even more. Yeah, $300,000 something. Yeah. But if you have €300,000 to burn, you could make a block like that and just challenge the ecosystem and say, hey, here's a block, let me see if you actually verify it. Then if you're a minor. So then if that block goes to notes that are upgraded, those will reject it. If that block goes to notes that are not upgraded, it's fine, it's accepted. But then if somebody mines on top of it, if that miner has not upgraded, they will not check it, they will build on top of it, and then eventually the ecosystem will probably reject that entire chain and it becomes a mess. So then you really, really want a very large majority of miners to really check the blocks, not just mine blindly in general, there are already problems with miners just blindly mining on top of other miners, if even for a few seconds for economic reasons. Yeah. So that was a long tangent on the problems with false signaling, because all of this would only happen if miners are false signaling. Yeah, and false signaling. To be clear, it's not some malicious act, it's just a lazy, convenient thing you say. Yeah, don't worry, I'll do my homework. I'll send you that memo in time. Don't worry. Yes, I haven't upgraded yet, but I will upgrade and you will know the difference for now. So yeah, that's sort of the risk of false signaling. It could be delivered too, but that would have to be a pretty large conspiracy then. Yeah, I guess. One other sort of concern, one risk that has been mentioned is that using lots falls in general just could help users launch a USF because they could run a USF client with lot two and then incentivize miners to signal like we just mentioned. And that would not only mean they would fork off to their own Softwork themselves, but basically activate the software for the entire economy. That's not a problem in itself. But some people, I think, consider it a problem if users are incentivized to try a USF. Do you understand that problem? I guess if we go for this aid approach. Right. If we switch to using block height rather than timestamps, it is Flag Day. But the speedy trial doesn't use a Flag Day. I know. I'm saying that if you do a Flag Day, you cannot do a USF that triggers something else. Well, yeah. Well, you could maybe. Why not? What would you trigger? Well, you can basically run like there is a Flag Day out there. But you deploy software that requires signaling. Yes. That's what you said people would be running. Yeah. They can run that anyway. Even if there's a fact that they can decide to run a software that requires signaling, even though nobody will signal. Probably. But they could. Absolutely. But they cannot co op to call it that lot false notes if there's only a flight out there. Yeah, that's true. So they would require the signaling. But the lot false notes that are out there would be like, not even lot false. Like, the Flag Day notes that are out there would be like, okay, I don't know why you're not accepting these blocks, but there's no signal. There's nothing to activate. There's just my Flag Day. And I'm going to wait for my Flag Day. Yes. And I don't want to get into the weeds too much, but if there are no Lot false nodes to co Ops, then miners could just false signal. So now the USF nodes are activating Tap Root, but the rest of the network still hasn't got Tap Root activated. So now if the USF nodes ever send coins to a Tap Root address, they're going to lose their coins, at least on the rest of the network. And they wouldn't get the VRC advantage that they think they have. This sounds even more complicated than the stuff we talked about two weeks ago. Yes. That's why I mentioned I'm getting a little bit into the weeds now. But do you get the problem? Is this an argument for or against the Flag Day? This is basically. Well, depends on your perspective. Sure. That of somebody who does not want Bitcoin to implode in a huge fire and would like to see Tapwood activated. If you don't like USFS, if you don't want people to do USFS, then you might also not want lots of false notes out there. Yeah. Okay. So you're saying if you really want to not see USF exist at all. Yeah. I'm not terribly worried about these things existing. What I especially talked about two weeks ago is I'm not going to contribute to them. Probably. Right. Okay. So I just wanted to mention that is one argument against a lot of fault that I've seen out there. Not an argument I agree with myself either, but I've seen the argument, and. I think what you're saying is it's an argument for not using signaling but using a flag day. Yes. So even Speedy Trial uses signaling. And while it's shorter, it might still be long enough to throw a USF against it. Yes. And it is compatible with that, right. Because it uses signaling. It is perfectly compatible with somebody deploying a lot of Strew system and making a lot of noise about it. But I guess in this case, even the strongest lot of STUP opponents, one of them at least argued that it would be completely reckless to do that. So it sounds like, yeah, there are. No USF proponents out there right now who think this is a good idea, as far as I know, at least. Yeah, so far there are not.

          "text": "we get to some of the downsides of this proposal? Yes, some of the risks. I think the first one we kind of briefly mentioned because this thing is deployed quite quickly and because it's very clear that the activation of the rules is delayed, there is an incentive for miners to just signal rather than actually install the code. And then they could procrastinate on actually installing the software, and that's fine unless they procrastinate so long that they forget to actually enforce the rules. Yeah. Which sounds quite bad to me. Yeah, but that is bad. I agree. It's always possible for Minus to just signal and not actually enforce the rules. Right. This risk exists with any software deployment. Yes. Minus just fake signal. And that has happened in the past. We've seen fake signaling. It was a bit 66 software where we learned later that minors were fake signaling, in fact, because we saw big reorgs on the network. So that is definitely something we would want to avoid. Yeah. And I think we briefly explained this earlier, but we can explain it again, Bitcoin core. If you use that to create your blocks as a minor, there are some safety mechanisms in place to make sure that you do not create a block that is Invalid. However, if another miner creates a block that is Invalid, you will mine on top of it, and then you have a problem because the full notes that are enforcing Taproot will reject your block. And presumably most of the ecosystem, if the signaling thing works, will upgrade. But then you get into this whole very scary situation where you really hope that that's true and that not a massive part of the economy is too lazy to upgrade and you get a complete mess. Yes, correct. I think that the term we used we talked about is the idea of basically a troll. So you could have a troll user. Let's say I am a mean user and I'm going to create a transaction that is looks like a tap transaction, but is actually Invalid according to tapirt rules. Now the way that works, like the mechanism in Bitcoin to do so force is that you have this version number in your segment transaction. And so you say this is a segment version, one transaction and notes know that you're allowed to when you see a segment version, you don't know about, a higher version that you know about or tagworth version. Well, a separate version. Okay, sure, yeah. So current version of segment is version zero because we're nerds. And if you see a segward version transaction with one or higher, you assume that anybody can spend that money. That means that if somebody is spending from that address, you don't care. You don't consider the blocking valid as an old note, but a note that is aware of the version will check the rules. So what you could do as a troll is you could create a broken Snore signature. For example, you just take your Snore signature and you swap one bite. Then if that is seen by an old node, it says oh, this is separate version one. I don't know what that is. It's fine. Anybody could spend this. So I'm not going to check the signature. But the tap nodes will say hey, wait a minute, that's an Invalid signature. Therefore that's an Invalid block. We have a problem. Now there's a protection mechanism there that normal miners will not mine separate transactions that they don't know about. They will not mine segment version one if they're not upgraded. Isn't it also the case that regular notes will just not forward the transaction to other nodes? That's another safety mechanism, right? So there are two safety mechanisms. They're basically saying, hey, dear other note, I don't think you want to just give your money away. Or Alternatively, you're trying to do something super sophisticated that I don't understand to something called standardness. If you're doing something that is not standard, I'm not going to relay it. That is not a consensus rule and that's important. It means that you can compile your notes to relay those things and you can compile your minor to mine these things. But it's a food gun if you don't know what you're doing. But it's not against consensus. However, when a transaction is in a block, then you are dealing with consensus rules. And that again means that old nodes will look at it and say I don't care, I'm not going to check the signature because that's a higher version that I know about. But the notes that are upgraded will say hey wait a minute, this block contains a transaction that's Invalid. This block is Invalid. A troll user doesn't really send a chance to do much damage. No, because the transaction won't make it over the peer to peer network. And even if it does, it would only make it to minors. That will still reject it. Troll user probably can't do much harm. So our troll example of a user that swaps one bite in a schnoar signature, he tries to send this transaction, he sends it to a note that is upgraded. That note will say that's Invalid. Go away. I'm going to ban you now, or maybe not banned, but definitely gets angry. But if he sends it to a note that is not upgraded, that note will say, I don't know about this whole new Segregate version of yours. Go away. Don't send me this modern stuff. I'm like really old school send me old stuff. So the transaction doesn't go anywhere. But maybe somehow it does end up with the miner. Then the miner says, well, I'm not going to mine this thing that I don't know about. That's dangerous because I might lose all my money. However, you may have a troll miner. Now that would be very expensive trolling, but we have billionaires in this ecosystem. So if you mine a block that is Invalid, it's going to cost you a few hundred thousand euros. I think at the current prices, maybe even more. Yeah, $300,000 something. Yeah. But if you have €300,000 to burn, you could make a block like that and just challenge the ecosystem and say, hey, here's a block, let me see if you actually verify it. Then if you're a minor. So then if that block goes to notes that are upgraded, those will reject it. If that block goes to notes that are not upgraded, it's fine, it's accepted. But then if somebody mines on top of it, if that miner has not upgraded, they will not check it, they will build on top of it, and then eventually the ecosystem will probably reject that entire chain and it becomes a mess. So then you really, really want a very large majority of miners to really check the blocks, not just mine blindly in general, there are already problems with miners just blindly mining on top of other miners, if even for a few seconds for economic reasons. Yeah. So that was a long tangent on the problems with false signaling, because all of this would only happen if miners are false signaling. Yeah, and false signaling. To be clear, it's not some malicious act, it's just a lazy, convenient thing you say. Yeah, don't worry, I'll do my homework. I'll send you that memo in time. Don't worry. Yes, I haven't upgraded yet, but I will upgrade and you will know the difference for now. So yeah, that's sort of the risk of false signaling. It could be delivered too, but that would have to be a pretty large conspiracy then. Yeah, I guess. One other sort of concern, one risk that has been mentioned is that using lots falls in general just could help users launch a USF because they could run a USF client with lot two and then incentivize miners to signal like we just mentioned. And that would not only mean they would fork off to their own Softwork themselves, but basically activate the software for the entire economy. That's not a problem in itself. But some people, I think, consider it a problem if users are incentivized to try a USF. Do you understand that problem? I guess if we go for this aid approach. Right. If we switch to using block height rather than timestamps, it is Flag Day. But the speedy trial doesn't use a Flag Day. I know. I'm saying that if you do a Flag Day, you cannot do a USF that triggers something else. Well, yeah. Well, you could maybe. Why not? What would you trigger? Well, you can basically run like there is a Flag Day out there. But you deploy software that requires signaling. Yes. That's what you said people would be running. Yeah. They can run that anyway. Even if there's a fact that they can decide to run a software that requires signaling, even though nobody will signal. Probably. But they could. Absolutely. But they cannot co op to call it that lot false notes if there's only a flight out there. Yeah, that's true. So they would require the signaling. But the lot false notes that are out there would be like, not even lot false. Like, the Flag Day notes that are out there would be like, okay, I don't know why you're not accepting these blocks, but there's no signal. There's nothing to activate. There's just my Flag Day. And I'm going to wait for my Flag Day. Yes. And I don't want to get into the weeds too much, but if there are no Lot false nodes to co Ops, then miners could just false signal. So now the USF nodes are activating Tap Root, but the rest of the network still hasn't got Tap Root activated. So now if the USF nodes ever send coins to a Tap Root address, they're going to lose their coins, at least on the rest of the network. And they wouldn't get the VRC advantage that they think they have. This sounds even more complicated than the stuff we talked about two weeks ago. Yes. That's why I mentioned I'm getting a little bit into the weeds now. But do you get the problem? Is this an argument for or against the Flag Day? This is basically. Well, depends on your perspective. Sure. That of somebody who does not want Bitcoin to implode in a huge fire and would like to see Tapwood activated. If you don't like USFS, if you don't want people to do USFS, then you might also not want lots of false notes out there. Yeah. Okay. So you're saying if you really want to not see USF exist at all. Yeah. I'm not terribly worried about these things existing. What I especially talked about two weeks ago is I'm not going to contribute to them. Probably. Right. Okay. So I just wanted to mention that is one argument against a lot of fault that I've seen out there. Not an argument I agree with myself either, but I've seen the argument, and. I think what you're saying is it's an argument for not using signaling but using a flag day. Yes. So even Speedy Trial uses signaling. And while it's shorter, it might still be long enough to throw a USF against it. Yes. And it is compatible with that, right. Because it uses signaling. It is perfectly compatible with somebody deploying a lot of Strew system and making a lot of noise about it. But I guess in this case, even the strongest lot of STUP opponents, one of them at least argued that it would be completely reckless to do that. So it sounds like, yeah, there are. No USF proponents out there right now who think this is a good idea, as far as I know, at least. Yeah, so far there are not. But we talked about in September, I think we talked about this cowboy theory. So I'm sure there's somebody out there that will try USF. Even on the Speedy trial, you can't exclude the possibility. At least there's another argument against ",

Lightning bitcoin, just like all of that, is kind of washed into the background and it's just superior payment rails. And I as a user would think that I'm receiving dollars or sending dollars. And that's kind of the magic of this all working, right? That's right. So you wouldn't have to know how the tech works to receive the benefit. And I think, of course, the best technologies are like that. However, my true expectation is that receiving digital dollars on Lightning network will be a great way to introduce bitcoin and a bitcoin standard to a broader audience. And so what I expect to see, for example, is perhaps a distributed workforce development to backtrack for a second to integrate your last question with this one. One of the companies I think that will be benefited by Tarot is a company like Stackwork that's managing the distributed workforce to introduce the opportunity to work and plug into the global economy just by completing work on your smartphone. Now, perhaps Taro allows a company or a platform like that to pay their digital workers in dollars. And those workers could have the option to receive and hold in dollars in their checking account while at the same time allocating some bitcoin or some of their digital dollars to bitcoin to hold in a savings account. It gives people more flexibility to sort of decide how to make best use of their wealth, how to store it, what needs to go for monthly spending. Tarot will allow people to use Lightning network for the purpose of sending dollars. But my belief is that the repercussions of that will be that people become curious about bitcoin because they see the value of the underlying tech. They're already using the network, they're already paying in bitcoin, by the way, because when you send a transaction in the Lightning network and when a transaction is committed on the bitcoin blockchain, you're paying in bitcoin regardless of whether you're sending, ultimately, whether this receiver is receiving dollars or bitcoin, it's still being paid for in bitcoin. And I think all of those things will create a curiosity and money that leads to the adoption of bitcoin and bitcoin for savings for a breadth of different groups. What are you seeing from a trend standpoint in terms of the types of people who are building these bitcoin companies or bitcoin infrastructure? Are they bitcoin folks who then start companies? Are the entrepreneurs who are looking for a problem to solve and end up liking and finding value in the infrastructure? What does that journey look like before these companies actually get started. It's all purpose driven. So we are seeing long term bitcoiners, understanding what's needed for bitcoin to scale and to gain both a greater number of users and a greater breadth of utility. So we absolutely are seeing that. And that's the majority of the companies that we back, by the way, right now. But in addition to that, we're seeing founders that are thinking about how to modernize the space they're building in. So let me give you an example again from our portfolio. It's a company called Pink Frog. Pink frog is a game studio, and the founders are formerly executives at King Studios, a very successful gaming studio. And actually, these founders are the folks that built Candy crush. So they developed Candy Crush. They built it to a scale of 100 million monthly active users. Now, what they were thinking about with Pink Frog was how to introduce a modern game that really sort of fit with young millennials and gen Z, both in terms of what the game introduced by way of entertainment, but also what it could introduce by way of gamers interacting with gamers and then with the game itself. And so they saw the opportunity to introduce lightning network as a way to increase engagement and the fun of the experience of community within their games. And so for them, Pink Frog is really just a gaming company, right? It's a gaming based startup. But that startup can provide a better experience to its users with lightning. So it's not just going to happen in the gaming space, although gaming certainly seems to be leading there. I also expect that we'll see founders from other verticals, from other sectors that will recognize the opportunity of lightning and bitcoin to make their products better, even if bitcoin and Lightning is not the core focus of their products.

You've been watching it for far longer than me and far longer than most. This time it just feels different because every week there's a new announcement. Every day almost, there's a new announcement and it's just like, wow, how does this keep coming and getting better and better so quickly? People have not stopped building. Yeah, I think you know what, I haven't really had a chance to stop because we're building. I have another stop to think about the fact that everybody's building, I feel like. And what's interesting is this, is I think, much more of a bitcoin thing than other things in other areas. Lots of hypothetical. Things are being launched and mooted. But in Bitcoin there's been a lot of foundational stuff that's been worked on in the background for a while. Taproot is finally giving birth to Tap roots, it's rearing its head and it's being pulled out right now with umbilical cords about to be cut and lightning was born a few years ago, but it's now getting to the point where it's walking, it's toddling around and it's starting to ask questions of interviewers about anime. It's got to a certain level of maturity. So because we can see that there and because this infrastructure is in place, all of this pent up desire to build on top of it is now able to be executed upon. And even then. Further along the line you've got things like RGB and stuff like that that are coming down the line. Which albeit early. But by the time we finished catching up on all this pent up desire to build on top of these layer two technologies or these next level features for Bitcoin. We have another sort of onslaught of new developments that we can create by the time that RGB starts becoming mature and things like that. And liquid. Et cetera. So I think that's probably it. If I do stop a second to think about it, the other thing that I think is also is the last few years and it's still a little bit now, unfortunately, but to a much level, lesser extent, a lot of balance has been taken up behind the scenes on boring but really important stuff for a company if they want to maintain a business. Regulation and compliance and regulatory stuff and the lack of clarity on that made it very difficult to make progress because it took a lot of focus, it still does, but I think it's getting clearer and because it's getting clearer, you don't need to spend so much brain space on it. And so instead of 20% of your brain based on building and 80% of regulation, you now can get to 50 50 over time, more and more. And so you're seeing all of that brain power being focused on actual the product. Actually helping the customers and so that's just really exciting what's going ",

So in Lightning, you have the property that the person being paid does not know who it is that originated the payment. So when you're paying over lightning, it's onion routed. It's essentially a similar technology to the Dark Web. And on the Dark Web, websites don't know the IP addresses of their clients, of the people who are accessing the website. So it's very similar on Lightning, it's uninterrupted the person getting paid doesn't know who the person paying them is. And then furthermore, you have this kind of receipt associated with your payment on the Lightning network that's atomic with the payment going through. So either the payment fails somewhere, in which case it fails everywhere, or it goes through everywhere along the route. Alice pays, Bob pays, Carol pays Dave, and all of them either fail or all of them work. And if all of them work, then atomic with that you also get the receipt, which is this hash pre image. So you get the secret that access the receipt over the lightning network. Lightning network has receipts and you can use that kind of as like an encryption key, so to speak, where you give them the encrypted data. And so then if they pay, then if and only if they pay, they get their data. And in this case the data being like that signature. And in the future, once we have taproot, once we have PTLCs, once we integrate PTLCs into lightning, whatever those are, that's a tangent for later, maybe we'll get there just once we have that stuff. You can actually do this in a very trustless way where you can be guaranteed that the pre image, your proof of payment, your receipt is exactly the signature of this message by this Oracle acquiring any kind of fancy stuff. But anyway, so in the future, especially today, you can do it since you're already trusting the oracle, you can do it where you just trust them. That the thing you pay for is just random garbage. And if it is, you can make some noise about it. But yeah. So one of the routes is monetizing over lightning. I think this makes a lot of sense. I would be very surprised if this wasn't one of the primary ways that Oracle, at least in the short term, are monetizing. Another funny thing is that this is. Actually lends to an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage too, in a sense. Because if gambling is not legal in the country or whatever that this Oracle exists in, the Oracle is not facilitating gambling. They're not a platform for people to gamble on. They're literally paying for just access to get a piece of information, like to just get a broadcast that this guy won the fight and Mayweather won the fight, not the other guy.

I've been running a betting platform. Yes, exactly. It certainly makes the argument harder. It's a gray area, it's a great. One of these places. Yeah. If you plan on making it big and like this is your life's goal, to be in Oracle service, you should probably hire a lawyer or learn some law related to this. I don't know exactly.

      "text": "pools are pretty distributed right now. So together, since this article was released and they got responses back with Slushpool, BTC.com and pooling they've got about BTC.com is actually only about 11%. Pooling is about 12%, or at least kind of by current estimates, I guess it would be the last 100 blocks or something that this is working from. Oh, no, last seven days. Last seven days, of course, over the last day, which does obviously have a bit more variation, pooling is about 11%, BTC.com is about 12%. And then what was it? Slushpool is like 2.26%, whereas on the seven day it's 2.46%. So not a huge amount of variation, but it's literally somewhere around 28% that's essentially giving A, their support for taproot and then B, the mechanism that they want to see it activated with. And what's funny is that all three of them, Slushpoolin and BTC.com, actually have a different activation preference, essentially, that they have shown on taproofactivation.com. So it'll be really cool to see a standard kind of develop from this, but the other big ones to reach out to, and hopefully we hear from soon, which F two pool is the largest, somewhere between 18% to 20% of the total hash rate. F two pool has historically, I think if I remember correctly, they were one with Slush pool that actually did SegWit pretty quickly. So they're usually up on this. And the fact this is literally days old, it's like a day or two maybe, at this point. It's really great that we're already seeing responses as quickly. And hopefully, hopefully within a couple of weeks you get some sort of recognition from all the major pools, which would be F Two pool binance, ant, pool Huebi via BTC, canoe, which I don't even know about canoe Lubian, then you got Slush, BTC top, but after that, the pools become small enough that basically we're already past the threshold. And this is kind of the really cool thing about the pools, even though they're a centralization risk in the sense that they are directing a lot of hash power with something like the Stratum v two, which is Stratum is the protocol they use to allow all the miners to work together in these pools. So just for anybody who doesn't really know what a pool is, or just kind of a vague idea, thousands of miners are logging into a single pool and then all hashing as if they're one big miner together, and the pool is essentially directing what everybody is hashing for. And that's done with its own little protocol, some little software implementation, and that's called Stratum. And the new one, Stratum version two, actually eliminates the issues where the pool itself gets to decide which client they run or which client they are mining on, which transactions get included. Like users can actually individual miners can actually build their own blocks. So censorship and control by the pool is not an issue anymore, which is really important because pools are single points of failures. Single points of failure. However, they are really handy in the fact that they essentially have a direct communication with a massive pool of miners. So they can essentially say, this pool is going to be recognizing tap root at this point and you guys either need to upgrade or we're not going to accept your hashes, we are going to move forward. So it's still a way to put a little pressure to get people to pay attention to upgrades like this and changes with software changes and things without actually having explicit control over the minor or what the miner does. So it's kind of a double edged sword in that sense. ",

Pooling is about 12%, or at least kind of by current estimates, I guess it would be the last 100 blocks or something that this is working from. Oh, no, last seven days. Last seven days, of course, over the last day, which does obviously have a bit more variation, pooling is about 11%, BTC.com is about 12%. And then what was it? Slushpool is like 2.26%, whereas on the seven day it's 2.46%. So not a huge amount of variation, but it's literally somewhere around 28% that's essentially giving A, their support for taproot and then B, the mechanism that they want to see it activated with. And what's funny is that all three of them, Slushpoolin and BTC.com, actually have a different activation preference, essentially, that they have shown on taproofactivation.com. So it'll be really cool to see a standard kind of develop from this, but the other big ones to reach out to, and hopefully we hear from soon, which F two pool is the largest, somewhere between 18% to 20% of the total hash rate. F two pool has historically, I think if I remember correctly, they were one with Slush pool that actually did SegWit pretty quickly. So they're usually up on this. And the fact this is literally days old, it's like a day or two maybe, at this point. It's really great that we're already seeing responses as quickly. And hopefully, hopefully within a couple of weeks you get some sort of recognition from all the major pools, which would be F Two pool binance, ant, pool Huebi via BTC, canoe, which I don't even know about canoe Lubian, then you got Slush, BTC top, but after that, the pools become small enough that basically we're already past the threshold. And this is kind of the really cool thing about the pools, even though they're a centralization risk in the sense that they are directing a lot of hash power with something like the Stratum v two, which is Stratum is the protocol they use to allow all the miners to work together in these pools. So just for anybody who doesn't really know what a pool is, or just kind of a vague idea, thousands of miners are logging into a single pool and then all hashing as if they're one big miner together, and the pool is essentially directing what everybody is hashing for. And that's done with its own little protocol, some little software implementation, and that's called Stratum. And the new one, Stratum version two, actually eliminates the issues where the pool itself gets to decide which client they run or which client they are mining on, which transactions get included. Like users can actually individual miners can actually build their own blocks. So censorship and control by the pool is not an issue anymore, which is really important because pools are single points of failures. Single points of failure. However, they are really handy in the fact that they essentially have a direct communication with a massive pool of miners. So they can essentially say, this pool is going to be recognizing tap root at this point and you guys either need to upgrade or we're not going to accept your hashes, we are going to move forward. So it's still a way to put a little pressure to get people to pay attention to upgrades like this and changes with software changes and things without actually having explicit control over the minor or what the miner does. So it's kind of a double edged sword in that sense. ",

      "text": "say two things about that. First of all, you're right that we can't know how many people or what part of the economy was actually running it and was actually prepared to go along with it. And because that question was never really resolved, that's why the argument is still going. And then the other part now we're getting another level deeper is what actually defines software. Because what in 2017 did was it really sort of mandated the signaling. And then you can wonder if you require minors to signal to activate a software, is that in itself a soft work, or is that sort of scaffolding for software? We should probably ask these guys what they think now, because I think this. Is like move at least one layer back. Yeah. I mean, I was going to say one thing I do feel for Jeremy. I mean, this is definitely a rough process, and I think everyone would agree with that. I guess I'm going to counter with something that Jeremy keeps bringing up, which is a great point. Right now he's got a bounty for 5.5 Bitcoin, which is just over $200,000 at the current price in US dollars in order to break CTV. So basically he's like tempting other developers maintainers or anyone for that matter that knows how to code to break his proposal. And he's willing to put a decent amount of Bitcoin, I would say, on the line to do so, I guess. Is there any comments, Pete, or errand to that? Is that a good model? Should there be a different model for this? Look, I think there's a lot of people who would say that Jeremy has done things in an interesting way. So I think in addition to evaluating Jeremy's specific technical proposal, the community is also confronting this idea that Jeremy sort of advocated for Ops CTV in a certain way. Right. So in the past, most of the technical proposals on Bitcoin have really happened on the developer mailing list and with developers like within GitHub and within that process. When we say Bitcoin Core, you're really talking about the developers contributing to Bitcoin core, having those technical discussions and then ultimately deciding to generate something in the software, Jeremy has done a little bit differently. Right. His sort of claim here is that he's engaged with the industry. The industry wants this. He's also making the claim that developers are a bit out of touch with the industry by sort of not implementing new features that they want. And he's created a website, he's created videos. He has like these graphics that explain what Ops the TV does. He's had IRC meetings about where people can talk about the proposal. He's put up Bounties, and he's generally pushed forward the conversation into the public sphere in a way where users, I think, feel closer to this. Right. They know that Jeremy is advocating for something and that this is a proposal that he's passionate about. I think what the developers object to, and that is that there are other proposals in Bitcoin that are probably as popular right now as Opsy. Tv. But they're not getting that attention. And one of the reasons they're not getting that attention is because Jeremy has advocated for a certain way. So I think in addition to people feeling differently about opposite TV as a specific piece of technology, they're also feeling very conflicted about Jeremy's actual process because in a certain sense, he's kind of politically campaigning for Opsy. Tv. Right. He's sort of created this way where he almost looks like a politician. He's got this website, he's got his proposal, he's going to hit you on Twitter, he's going on Twitter spaces, he's evangelizing for that. And that is in itself pretty new. Right. We have not seen developers historically do that in the past, even with tap Root. I mean, I'm sure you guys can't tell me where that proposal came from. Like who specifically proposed it? I mean, people who follow the mailing list, we would know that segment kind of the same thing. This is the first time when really there's just been such a strong, singular developer identity tied to this. And then he specifically sort of pushed that. And I think culturally that just rubs a lot of the old kind of Bitcoin core contributors. And again, these are the biggest names in the technical space who have contributed some of the biggest advances to Bitcoin that's rubbed them the wrong way. And they're not even engaging with it just because of the way the social signaling is taking place. So if we back up for a second, using your kind of distinction, Pete, of monetary maximalism versus platform maximalism. Jeremy is without a doubt a a platform maximalist. I would say, in his own words yesterday, I mean, Bitcoin will be at risk to fail and will not become the be all, end all. And he might move to Ethereum if we don't put in this upgrade. So, I mean, what do you think about that? Do you guys think Bitcoin can sort of ossify right now, or do we need something like this? Jeremy certainly has fans amongst people who don't think Bitcoin should occupy. Right. Because one of the things that he's the specific Op CD proposal is getting a lot of positive attention for is it kind of presents this way forward where users are more like tightly integrated into this technical consensus process. So I think what Aaron was alluding to so he was using some specific terms. I'll just break those down. Like this was back during the Fork War period where it was unclear how we would upgrade Bitcoin. What happened was technical consensus was reached. The miners were not signaling. So then what happened was the Bitcoin developers of the day sort of appealed to the users or some subset of them did. So what happened during that event and why it's kind of you have to really study it to really understand the Bitcoin consensus processes. Again, the developers kind of all agreed on something that somebody had technical consensus that it was the best in class solution for the problem. The miners still weren't sort of signaling for it. So then someone created a new piece of software that appeals to the users. And ultimately what got SegWit activated was that people upgraded to SegWit and they never really ran the software that the users are running. But people got the overwhelming idea that the users supported this and the developers supported this. Everyone upgraded. The industry sort of back down that process. It's not clear how that's scalable. Right. It was a very acrimonious process. So I think what people like about what Jeremy is doing is that he's doing some flavor of that. He's saying, okay, we don't have technical consensus. I'm going to go about the software change in the same way that this previous software change did, where when there was conflict, we appealed to the users. Right. And so now it's sort of introducing this whole other layer of well, the real truth of that is the developers were never really, I think, totally on board with that there's this idea that I think you and one of your earlier questions about how our users involved in the process of becoming consensus and Bitcoin upgrades, it's actually pretty unclear. In cases like Taproot, they've actually totally been not really that involved. Right. You have developers that introduced the software, they all agree that it's the best in class solution, and then sort of the miners are asked to signal that they would upgrade to the software and then we make the change based on the minor signaling. That's why when you see the tweets like, oh, 80% of the miners are signaling for Taproot, that's what's happening. It's like this hash power is being pulled and then the change kind of goes through and there's never a point where it's like UQ or you, Alex, and your node really matters in that conversation. So you also have this kind of metal layer of okay, when is it okay to just appeal to the masses like your average Bitcoin node runner? And when is it okay to get them in there? So I get it. There's a lot of layers to this right there's. Like what is technical consensus? When is technical consensus achieved? How do you feel specifically about Jeremy, what he's doing both to kind of publicize this and then three, how do you kind of feel about his specific use of tactics to really drum support of that? And I think there's criticism in every layer, and that's why there's no consensus here yet. People are sort of unpacking this massive amount of information that's coming out. You kind of want to present this philosophical ",

      "text": "in time, it's four years later, and now the tap route upgrade is ready to go. And what happened a couple of years ago is now spurring new debate on the tabloid upgrade. And that brings us to the last parameter, which is a new parameter, although it's sort of inspired by things from that Segways upgrade period. It's basically like a built in USF option which you can decide to use or not. But it's basically there is now a sort of a formal way in the protocol to do this, to activate a software like at a cut off date. Yeah. So Lot has two options. The first option is false. So that's Lot is false. That means that minors can signal for the upgrade for one year, and then in that year, if there's 90% threshold for the upgrades, it will activate. As we just explained, by the way, one year and 90% isn't set in stone. But that's sort of what people seem to settle on. For convenience sake. That's just what I'm going to use while discussing this. So miners have one year to activate the upgrade. If after that year they have not upgraded, the temporary upgrade will expire. It will just not happen. Basically that's a lot is false. And of course, there's always the option then of shipping any release trying again, it's not a no vote, but nothing happens. Yeah, exactly, yeah. Okay. Then there's lot is true, which again, miners have one year to signal support for the upgrade. If 90% threshold is met, then the upgrade will activate. However, the big difference is what happens if miners don't reach this threshold if they don't signal for the upgrade. In that case, when the year is almost over, nodes that have lots is true will start to reject all blocks that don't signal for the upgrade. In other words, the only accepts blocks that will signal for the upgrade. Which means, of course, that the 90% threshold will be met, and therefore tabloid or any other software in this mechanism will activate if enough blocks are produced. If enough blocks are produced, yes, that's true. A little bit of nuance is that for those who find it interesting, even lot is true nodes will accept up to 10% of blocks that don't signal. That's to avoid weird change plate scenarios. Yeah. Basically because if it activates in a normal way, only 90% has a signal. So if you mandate signaling, then it would be weird to have a different percentage suddenly. Yeah. So they're going to accept the first 10% of non signaling blocks. But after that, every block that doesn't signal is going to be rejected. So that 90% threshold will definitely be reached. Now, the big reason for this lot is true for that parameter to set it to true is that this way miners cannot block the upgrade. Even if they try to block the upgrades once years over, notes will still enforce tabloid. So it's guaranteed to happen if enough blocks are produced. If enough blocks are produced. Yeah. We can get into some of the risks with this, but I think you want to continue explaining a bit. Yeah. So in other words, the reason some people like lot is true is because that way miners don't have a veto. Now, the counterargument there and you already sort of suggested that is that miners don't have a veto anyways. Even if we use lot is false, the upgrade would expire after a year. But after that year, we can just deploy a new upgrade mechanism and a new signaling period. And this time, maybe you slot is true. Yes. Or even while this thing is going on. Right. So you could wait half a year with a lot of false and then half a year later saying, okay, this is taking too long, let's take a little bit more risk and set lot to true. Exactly. Or lower the threshold. Yes. Or some other permutation that slightly increases the risk but also increases the likeliness of activation. Yeah, you're right. But that's actually also one of the arguments against using lot is false. Lot is true. Proponents say that because you just suggest that we can do it after six months. But there's another group of users that might say no, first wait until the year is over, and then we'll just redeploy again. So let's say that after six months that boot hasn't activated. Now all of a sudden you get a new discussion between people that want to start deploying lots to clients right away and groups of users that want to wait until the year is over. So it's sort of reintroducing the discussion we're having now, except by then we only have six months to resolve it. It's like a ticking time bomb kind of situation. Well, not really to resolve it, if you don't do anything for six months, then there's only one option left, which is to just try again with the new activation bit. Yeah. But then you need to agree on when you're actually going to do that. Are you going to do that after six months or are you going to do that later? And people might disagree. That's true where we are now, except, you know, a little bit more, because now you know that the miners weren't signaling. Yeah. And you don't have a lot of time to resolve it because after six months something might happen. Some group of users might run through. Yeah. The thing you're talking about here is the possibility of, say, anarchy in the sense that there's no consensus about when to activate this thing. And one group, I think we discussed it at length in the third episode. One group just gets really aggressive and says, no, we're going to activate this earlier. And so then nobody knows when it's going to happen. Yes. Well, and also let me put it differently, if right now we're saying, okay, if after six months minors haven't activated for tabloid, then we'll just upgrade to Lotus true clients after six months. And a lot of through proponents will say, well, if that's the plan anyways, let's just do it now. That's much easier. Why do we have to do that halfway? Right. So that's sort of the counter argument to the counter argument. Yeah, I can see that. But of course, there's also the scenario where we never do this where Taproot just doesn't activate. I mean, it just depends on what people want. But there is something to be said for a status quo bias where you don't do anything if it's too controversial for whatever reason. Now, there's another sort of a site case here that it's useful to keep in mind that might be a very good reason to cancel Taproot. Right. There might just be a book that. You'Re getting ahead of me. Sure, you're getting ahead of me because there are a bunch of arguments in favor of lot is false. Okay, so one argument is we've basically already done lot of false. Lot is false. A bunch of times the previous minor activated Softworks, and most of the times it went fine. It was just this one time with Segregate in the midst of a big war, and we don't have a big war now. There's no reason to change what we've been doing successfully until now. There's one argument. The counter argument would, for example, be, yeah, but if you choose a lot of false now, that could actually draw controversy itself. That could be used to drive a wedge or we're not in a war right now, but it could cause a war. Yeah, but I don't see how that argument doesn't apply to a lot of true. That's probably fair. I tend to agree with that. Okay, then the other argument for Loftus faults is that miners, and especially mining pools have already indicated that they are supportive of Taproot and that I'll activate it, and it's not necessary to do the lot is true thing as far as we can tell. The third argument is what you just mentioned is that it's possible that maybe someone finds a bug with Taboos software bug, or maybe some other problem is possible. If you do lots of false, it's fairly easy to just let it expire and users won't have to upgrade their software again. Right. The only thing then you'd have to recommend that miners do not install that upgrade. And it's worth noting, I think we pointed this out in episode three. People don't always review things very early, so it's very possible that a lot of people have reviewed tabloid code, but others might not bother to review it until the activation code is there because they just wait for the last minute. So it's not implausible that somebody very smart starts reviewing this very late. Perhaps some exchange that's about to deploy it. Yeah, something like that happened with the P Two Sh. So the predecessor to P Two Sh, I think that was just about to be deployed, and then a pretty horrible bug was found. Yeah, we've seen it with certain altcoins, too. That right. Before deployment, people find zero days, either because they're bullies or just because the code was shipped in a rush and nobody checked it. Yeah. So there is definitely always a risk. Whatever software mechanism you use that a bug is discovered at the last minute, and if you're really unlucky, then it's too late, it's deployed, and you need a hard fork to get rid of it, which would be really bad. Well, no, I don't think that's true. There are other ways to get rid of it. You may be able to Softwork depending on what the bug is, you may be able to soft work it out. Yeah, there are ways to fix it, even in that case. The other sort of counter argument to that point would be, well, if we're not sure that it's bug free, and if we're not sure that this upgrade is correct, then it shouldn't be deployed either way, not in false or true or anything. So we need to be sure of that anyways. Yeah, but like I said, some people won't review something until it is sort of inevitable. Yeah, I'm just lifting the arguments. That's all right. Okay. Fourth argument. So the fourth argument for Lot is false, basically, or against Lot is true. Is that a Lot is true. Am I saying that right? Against Lot is true? Yeah, lot is true. Could feed into the perception that Bitcoin, and especially Bitcoin core developers, control the protocol, have power over the protocol because they're shipping code. And that becomes sort of necessarily becomes the new protocol rules in the case of Tap roots. So that perception could there could be. Some future soft work where really nobody in the community cares about it, but just a handful of Bitcoin core developers do, and they kind of force it onto the community and then you get a bunch of chaos. The nice thing about having at least the minus signal is that they are part of the community and at least they are okay with it. But the problem is it doesn't reflect what other people in the community think about it. It just reflects what they think about it. So there's a bunch of mechanisms, right. There is a discussion on the mailing list, and you see, if people have problems, then there's the minor signaling, which is a nice indication that people are happy. So you could just see it as that as many people consenting as possible. It would be nice if there were other mechanisms, of course. Yeah. The other point is that Bitcoin core developers, while they decide which software they include in Bitcoin core, which code they include in Bitcoin core, they don't decide what users actually end up running. Yeah, exactly. They don't actually have power of the network. So in that sense, the argument is bunk, but it could still feed into the perception that they do, and even that perception, if you can avoid it, maybe that's better. That's sort of an argument and the precedent. Right. What if, I don't know, big inquiry is compromised at some point and ships an update and says, well, if you don't stop it, then it's going to activate. And then it's actually nice if the miners can say, no, I don't think so. But users could say that as well by not downloading it, like you said. Okay, now we get to the fifth argument, and this is where it gets pretty complex. Okay. So the fifth argument against what is true is that it could cause all sorts of network instability. If it happens that the year is over and there are lots to clients on the network, it's possible that they would split off from the main chain and there could be reorgs and people could lose money and miners could mine Invalid block and lose their block rewards and all that sort of stuff. Yeah, the Lot is true. Proponents argue that that risk is actually best mitigated if people adopt what is true. Yeah, I'm very skeptical. That sounds very circular. But maybe it's useful to explain what these bad scenarios look like. That's exactly where I wanted to get at. Yeah. And then others can decide whether they think those bad scenarios are worth risking and B whether they think how to make them less likely. Because some of that, I think, is almost political. It's kind of like you have all these discussions in society, should people have guns or not, and what's the incentives and you may never figure that out, but we can talk about some of the mechanics here. Just to be clear, if somehow there would be complete consensus on the network over either lot is true, all notes run lot is true, or all notes run lot is false, then I think that would be totally fine either way. Yeah, but the irony, of course, is that if there's complete consensus and everybody runs Lotus true, then it will never be used. But you're right, in theory. Well, I mean, even if miners wouldn't. Yeah. I don't see a scenario where we're happy with what is true. We're just not deliberately not going to signal and then signal at the very last moment. Yeah, you're right. But we're also digressing. The point is that the really complicated scenarios arise when some parts of the network are running lot is true, some parts of the network are running lot is false, or some parts of the network are running neither because they haven't upgraded or some combination of these. Half of the network has two, half of the network is neither. That's where things get very complicated and short. You thought about it. What do you think ",

          "text": "in time, it's four years later, and now the tap route upgrade is ready to go. And what happened a couple of years ago is now spurring new debate on the tabloid upgrade. And that brings us to the last parameter, which is a new parameter, although it's sort of inspired by things from that Segways upgrade period. It's basically like a built in USF option which you can decide to use or not. But it's basically there is now a sort of a formal way in the protocol to do this, to activate a software like at a cut off date. Yeah. So Lot has two options. The first option is false. So that's Lot is false. That means that minors can signal for the upgrade for one year, and then in that year, if there's 90% threshold for the upgrades, it will activate. As we just explained, by the way, one year and 90% isn't set in stone. But that's sort of what people seem to settle on. For convenience sake. That's just what I'm going to use while discussing this. So miners have one year to activate the upgrade. If after that year they have not upgraded, the temporary upgrade will expire. It will just not happen. Basically that's a lot is false. And of course, there's always the option then of shipping any release trying again, it's not a no vote, but nothing happens. Yeah, exactly, yeah. Okay. Then there's lot is true, which again, miners have one year to signal support for the upgrade. If 90% threshold is met, then the upgrade will activate. However, the big difference is what happens if miners don't reach this threshold if they don't signal for the upgrade. In that case, when the year is almost over, nodes that have lots is true will start to reject all blocks that don't signal for the upgrade. In other words, the only accepts blocks that will signal for the upgrade. Which means, of course, that the 90% threshold will be met, and therefore tabloid or any other software in this mechanism will activate if enough blocks are produced. If enough blocks are produced, yes, that's true. A little bit of nuance is that for those who find it interesting, even lot is true nodes will accept up to 10% of blocks that don't signal. That's to avoid weird change plate scenarios. Yeah. Basically because if it activates in a normal way, only 90% has a signal. So if you mandate signaling, then it would be weird to have a different percentage suddenly. Yeah. So they're going to accept the first 10% of non signaling blocks. But after that, every block that doesn't signal is going to be rejected. So that 90% threshold will definitely be reached. Now, the big reason for this lot is true for that parameter to set it to true is that this way miners cannot block the upgrade. Even if they try to block the upgrades once years over, notes will still enforce tabloid. So it's guaranteed to happen if enough blocks are produced. If enough blocks are produced. Yeah. We can get into some of the risks with this, but I think you want to continue explaining a bit. Yeah. So in other words, the reason some people like lot is true is because that way miners don't have a veto. Now, the counterargument there and you already sort of suggested that is that miners don't have a veto anyways. Even if we use lot is false, the upgrade would expire after a year. But after that year, we can just deploy a new upgrade mechanism and a new signaling period. And this time, maybe you slot is true. Yes. Or even while this thing is going on. Right. So you could wait half a year with a lot of false and then half a year later saying, okay, this is taking too long, let's take a little bit more risk and set lot to true. Exactly. Or lower the threshold. Yes. Or some other permutation that slightly increases the risk but also increases the likeliness of activation. Yeah, you're right. But that's actually also one of the arguments against using lot is false. Lot is true. Proponents say that because you just suggest that we can do it after six months. But there's another group of users that might say no, first wait until the year is over, and then we'll just redeploy again. So let's say that after six months that boot hasn't activated. Now all of a sudden you get a new discussion between people that want to start deploying lots to clients right away and groups of users that want to wait until the year is over. So it's sort of reintroducing the discussion we're having now, except by then we only have six months to resolve it. It's like a ticking time bomb kind of situation. Well, not really to resolve it, if you don't do anything for six months, then there's only one option left, which is to just try again with the new activation bit. Yeah. But then you need to agree on when you're actually going to do that. Are you going to do that after six months or are you going to do that later? And people might disagree. That's true where we are now, except, you know, a little bit more, because now you know that the miners weren't signaling. Yeah. And you don't have a lot of time to resolve it because after six months something might happen. Some group of users might run through. Yeah. The thing you're talking about here is the possibility of, say, anarchy in the sense that there's no consensus about when to activate this thing. And one group, I think we discussed it at length in the third episode. One group just gets really aggressive and says, no, we're going to activate this earlier.

What do you have more direct individual control over and access to at any given time and in practically unlimited amounts? Nothing. Now, add multisig to that.

I love that multisig is becoming the norm because that literally takes the unmatched deep protection of bitcoin and takes it a whole order of magnitude deeper and unchained. It's one of these services. Casa does the same thing. I think green address does it this exact same way from blockstream. So there's a bunch of these that are now taking advantage of this where they hold one of the keys, but they never actually have custody of your coins. So you can split up the two keys that you have, they have one key and they operate just as a failsafe and it's noncustodial. What could possibly do that? Can you imagine any like imagine if you had your gold and you could store the exact same gold in two separate places and if one of them got stolen, you could call up your bank who doesn't have your gold and it could restore your gold. I mean, obviously that would be insane. That sounds like magic. But this is normal business in Bitcoin and the more secure all of our Bitcoin are, the more secure the entire network and more importantly, the economy of Bitcoin is. So I mentioned that this is related to tap root. And see, the one drawback of multi SIG right now is that it costs more. It requires more keys, more signatures, and the more complex it is, the higher it costs. So if you're a company, I mean, now somebody like Michael Sailor or Square Crypto or all these major companies that are storing massive amounts of wealth don't have to worry about a $7 fee on blockchain as opposed to a $2 fee. Or even if they went crazy and did like a 506 hundred keys or something insane like that, even $1,000 fee on chain is not a huge thing. Like a company like that is used to spending orders of magnitude more money than that. Closing costs on a single piece of real estate is like ten X. So it's hilariously. Not a problem for somebody at that level. Multi SIG provides them with the most powerful tools for protection that you could ever hope to have in any asset. But for somebody who's storing $100 or $500, that makes a difference. Like whether you're spending ten or $20 on a transaction fee, if you have to store it with a lot of keys or you want to do like a family trust and you're just getting started or whatever like multisig is and just in general fees are going to go up. You want data efficiency, right? We want to treat this thing with as much care as we can and we don't want to blow the chain. That's the beauty of tap root. And we talked about this just in the other day and the guys take episode on taproot is merged. If you haven't listened to it do. We are now on the cusp of getting an activation method and getting this into a version of the client. I'm super stoked about this. Tap root hides all of it away. A multi SIG address ",

Not a problem for somebody at that level. Multi SIG provides them with the most powerful tools for protection that you could ever hope to have in any asset. But for somebody who's storing $100 or $500, that makes a difference. Like whether you're spending ten or $20 on a transaction fee, if you have to store it with a lot of keys or you want to do like a family trust and you're just getting started or whatever like multisig is and just in general fees are going to go up. You want data efficiency, right? We want to treat this thing with as much care as we can and we don't want to blow the chain. That's the beauty of tap root. And we talked about this just in the other day and the guys take episode on taproot is merged. If you haven't listened to it do. We are now on the cusp of getting an activation method and getting this into a version of the client. I'm super stoked about this. Tap root hides all of it away. A multi SIG address ",

I want to learn more about how first how Hawaii is utilizing the ocean to keep itself and the entire island sort of energized and the energy that you guys are capturing just on that side before we dive into the Bitcoin side of it. So at the moment, we're not this is actually a big problem. Hawaii was a sovereign nation, sovereign Kingdom. There's a palace here, Elani Palace. It's the only Royal Palace on US soil. It's a beautiful building. If you're ever in the area. Elani palace is a great day trip, as is the Bishop Museum. Some of the most beautiful places you'll ever see. And there was an active trade between Hawaii and some of the other Polynesian Islands for a while after the initial colonization by the Polynesians. But they decided at some point to halt all trade. There's even evidence of the Polynesian showing up in Central and North America hundreds of years before the Vikings and Columbus got here. But they just ceased and they became an entirely self sovereign nation. Fishing, it was all based around the water cycle. Farming. Tarot farming, which is you may have heard of the new lightning protocol. Tarot. Well, it's the staple roast beef. I saw his talk at Bitcoin 2022 and that guy is awesome. I got super hyped when he pulls out a bag of tarot chips because I eat those all the time. And it was all based around the ocean and they had 100% of their food, 100% of their energy needs were generated locally. But then, well, then we started trading, then Captain Cook showed up and now we are 90% reliant on external sources for food and mostly energy. In fact, I did this analysis on the state and we're at around 20 something percent low 20s. As far as renewable energy, it pushes up to 30 plus. When you include biofuels. I don't like to include biofuels in the renewable sector. I don't think burning trash is all that. I mean, we're going to keep producing trash, but whether that's a renewable source of energy is up for debate still. But actually at the moment, we don't get any energy from the ocean. Solar, wind are the main two components of the renewable penetration here. Outside of that, it's fossil fuels all the way. I'm genuinely curious of what your opinion on this matter is, and you seem to allude to it a little bit. What would you say then, sort of this the necessity or the way that Hawaii has handled sort of their energy structure and grid has become reliant on the fact that because they were brought in as a state in the 50s, they've then sort of in turn just followed suit with what the US government has dictated to them, whereas they were sort of operating on their own silo. And if they were able to continue to operate as such, they would be able to develop separate to what the American structure sort of looks like. Yeah. I mean, there's something to say for the benefit of statehood. If you come here, you see a lot of our buildings were built around in the 50s following statehood. You'll see the architecture that's consistent with that time just about everywhere. So there's something to be said there. But yeah, independence, both energy and food. Independence for the state of Hawaii is our biggest weakness and our reliance on the military. People don't understand that. Why is the most militarized piece of land on the planet? People think that it's the DMZ between Korea and North Korea. And no, it's actually why we have every major military base here. We have the Marines, the army, the Navy, the Air Force, Coastes, and of course, now Space Force. It's funny seeing the space force logo on building now the independence is really important as going forward trade, I guess D globalization is kind of happening. And being self reliant really goes a long way, especially when you're 2000 miles from the nearest landmark. And we'd absolutely need it. And we have all this energy. There's all this energy here. There's just very little incentive to go explore it. We actually have the curtailment issue here is one of the worst in the world. In the middle of the day, when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, we actually generate too much energy. And there's this mandate. What do you do with this energy? Well, you turn off the windmills. So you'll often see on the north shore of Oahu or on Maui, where the largest curtailment problem is you'll see these windmills just not turning. And you ask yourself, well, then why aren't we using that energy? And it's an issue. Demand response. Our current demand response thinking is that let's turn on air conditioning in buildings that aren't occupied to use up the. Energy that you guys have been storing. Yeah. And that leaves this deficit in funding. It's like, well, say, I'm building a wind farm and I'm trying to make the calculation. How soon is it going to pay back? Well, if I have to curtail energy, that makes that calculation a lot more difficult. And wind and solar, because they're intermittent. Right. They're only when the wind is blowing and only when the sun is shining, especially directly overhead, unless you have the tracking, which is more expensive, of course. So you want to use that energy when you have it. And if you have to turn it off in the middle of the day, it makes it unprofitable to build new, even though we have to, because we were the only state. Now with the Ukraine crisis, everybody rushed to ban Russian oil. There's only one state who actually used Russian oil, and that was us. So our energy prices, of course, our gasoline people are complaining about four or $5 for gas. And that was that's what we paid for years. What a gas price? I'm in Los Angeles, so I've got $6 a gallon right now. But it sounds like you've got me beat. It really depends where you go. So I go to Costco. And Costco. Costco has the cheapest energy. It's like five to five and a half. Yeah. That's the cheapest you can get higher elsewhere. But no, we drive, we make the commute to Costco to fill up whenever we're in town. So a worthy trip, to say the least. Yeah. It saves money ",

      "text": "What the hell is omnipolt? How does that play into setting up a Lightning node absent of Neutrino? How exactly does Omnibalt play in this? What's the foundation and use case for that? It's pretty simple, honestly. Omni Bolt is just a fork of LNG that supports the Omni layer. The Omni layer is a long existing networking format for using Bitcoin transactions and basically tainting the opcode with proprietary serialized information so you can recognize a token abstractions within Bitcoin transactions. Basically, you've been using operating yeah, okay. I don't know anything technically more beyond that as far as Omni, but just generally speaking, it's the colored coin sort of concept, and you're basically marking Bitcoin transactions with special information that only an Omni node or Omni network would recognize to be able to tack on token abstractions to Bitcoin transactions. And so Omni, essentially Omni transactions are Bitcoin transactions, they just have additional data that they're keeping track of to be able to also have tokens within these transactions. And so Omni is not a separate blockchain, it's not a side chain, it's just a network that tracks metadata, almost like slash tags in a way, but very specific use case to tracking the metadata within the opera that are specifically for Omni. And so you have this concept that's used for a long time, it was the original place that Tether was issued. It used to be all the first billion dollars of tether or so were all on Omni. And then when Bitcoin fees got to be high on Bitcoin network, tether and other stable coins started looking at other blockchains so they could issue the same assets on all coins instead to be able to utilize these low fees. Even though these blockchains are higher risk, they're not really attacked very much at least yet. And so there's a lot of utility to provide it if now you can have these barrier instruments that are even cheaper than on Bitcoin. And so Tether became a product that was more about representing their dollars as bearer instruments on any network and less about just only being a Bitcoin thing. But that is where it started. And so now these checkpoints are starting to become popular and they can't scale either. And so now we're back to the fee problem, right? This keeps repeating, right? Like you put Tyler on Tron, you put Taylor on Tyrion, and you just keep moving the hottest cheapest coin, right? And this is good for Tether because that's where all the trend of users are, so they always get to be able to access all of the users that might want dollar exposure. Because most of these shit coins they're using for speculating and trading against somehow anyway, like Defy was all about trying to arbitrage worthless inflated tokens made out of thin air or in its best representation, trying to achieve stable coins yourself. And you can't achieve stable coins, also stable algorithmic coins without actual stable coins. And so the whole thing is just like the turtles all the way down kind of trying to seize this liquidity. And you honestly cannot blame Tether for this because if people want all our exposure and they want it in their network specifically, and they also want it affordably, then they're going to take that product and give it to them. And so now, luckily, Bitcoin and the Bitcoin kind of development community at large is much more focused on optimization, scaling, and actually realizing and respecting the limitations of a blockchain. And due to this, we have been so lucky as people focusing on things like Lightning Network, focusing on things like taprooo and seguet. And so we actually have the best scaling in the world when it comes to blockchains. And so now that people are actually again, timing is better now there's actually Lightning technology that's usable. It's actually possible to put this into a mobile wallet and it not be a horrible user experience. It's starting to have a decent amount of users that even care about trying the Lightning network, a decent amount of investors willing to invest in companies that are creating Lightning network applications or platforms that support the Lightning network. So everything is looking a lot better now, and we're saying, okay, well, if the only way to scale bitcoin at this time for a high frequency, instant retail friendly commercial user experience. And that's essentially what Lightning is. It's commercial technology for bitcoin making. It enables the medium exchange use case to a much further degree on a scaling level, then it's the same thing for tokens. So now OmniBolt is basically a fork of LND that supports Omni layer. And so now we can take these bitcoin transactions that have Omni tokens in them, and now we can say, okay, let's make Lightning channels out of these Omni token abstractions. And so now what the Omnibort team has done is they've created this fork of L and D that allows you to have token channels and token networks. The challenge here is that what you learn when you work on this stuff, and I've been trying to get tokens on Lightning for three years. I've been involved in different projects. It's been a side goal of mine since I was at Bit refill. It's actually not probably a lot of people think it's something tether instigated or tether required, but they actually had nothing to do with anything to do with our token decisions. It just happened to be complimentary. We didn't seek each other out for those reasons in any way. Sorry, where was I? Oh, now you can have scalable token channels, you can have high frequency, which means now we can bring tokens to retail as well as bear instruments. And that's what's important to me, is that it's important to me that people have a way, businesses have a way of issuing credit, of issuing credit on their reputation even further. So now you have slash tags also to kind of help track and hold them accountable of issuing credit on their reputation, to be able to grow their businesses and be able to provide people high type preference assets that are actually relevant to them. So rather than just only like trusting, say, tether for your dollar exposure, you could choose instead to trust people that are actually within your economic relevance. You would say, okay, I use Aldo to do my shopping, and I want to always have some credit with them because I always spend $1,000 a month there shopping for my family. And so why wouldn't I rather hold Aldo credit or would I rather hold Tether credit for my shopping? Well, why not hold the credit and the thing that I actually need, right? It's much more relevant and you get to kind of support that business by giving them that capital upfront. And so they can now grow their business and speculate on that capital. And now it might actually benefit you in the end to have that money be with them instead of being held with tether. And so the idea here is to kind of if we want to have this atomic economy concept or a circular economy where bitcoin is the main store of value. I went deep into a rabbit hole on modeling all of this, and I thought in the end, like, what is finance? What is the minimum thing we need? Well, we definitely need a way for like, if you have one coffee shop and you want to open a second coffee shop, we need a way to accelerate that by leveraging your reputation, leveraging some form of credit with people that trust you to accelerate your growth in capitalism. And that is going to require at least a minimum, the ability to issue credit in some way, because I would add the ability to issue equity. But it's like mostly highly regulated right now to be able to issue equity. Much more regulated than issuing credit. Like, most jurisdictions allow people to issue, say, gift cards. And that is a form of credit that is sort of a better gift. Card is basically what you're talking about. Yeah. So you probably hear me talk about gift tokens a lot. So, yeah, that's my long answer to what is Omni? And OmniBolt OmniBolt is and I have no problem making this distinction, a separate lightning network from the bitcoin lightning network as we know it. But the problem is the interesting thing is it doesn't really matter because every asset that you add, whether it was on the same network or technically a different network, is a separate network because you need to bootstrap the liquidity, right? The channels need to actually have tethers in them if you want to create a tether channel network. And so it doesn't matter whether or not it's the same network or separate or separate network, because it's effectively separate no matter what. And the only way you can kind of bridge that gap is through atomic swapping. And so you could atomic swap intranetwork or you could atomic swap cross networks, and these are later stage capabilities that Omnipote will have as well. Man okay, before ",

And so the idea here is to kind of if we want to have this atomic economy concept or a circular economy where bitcoin is the main store of value. I went deep into a rabbit hole on modeling all of this, and I thought in the end, like, what is finance? What is the minimum thing we need? Well, we definitely need a way for like, if you have one coffee shop and you want to open a second coffee shop, we need a way to accelerate that by leveraging your reputation, leveraging some form of credit with people that trust you to accelerate your growth in capitalism. And that is going to require at least a minimum, the ability to issue credit in some way, because I would add the ability to issue equity. But it's like mostly highly regulated right now to be able to issue equity. Much more regulated than issuing credit. Like, most jurisdictions allow people to issue, say, gift cards. And that is a form of credit that is sort of a better gift. Card is basically what you're talking about. Yeah. So you probably hear me talk about gift tokens a lot. So, yeah, that's my long answer to what is Omni? And OmniBolt OmniBolt is and I have no problem making this distinction, a separate lightning network from the bitcoin lightning network as we know it. But the problem is the interesting thing is it doesn't really matter because every asset that you add, whether it was on the same network or technically a different network, is a separate network because you need to bootstrap the liquidity, right? The channels need to actually have tethers in them if you want to create a tether channel network. And so it doesn't matter whether or not it's the same network or separate or separate network, because it's effectively separate no matter what. And the only way you can kind of bridge that gap is through atomic swapping. And so you could atomic swap intranetwork or you could atomic swap cross networks, and these are later stage capabilities that Omnipote will have as well. Man okay, before ",

      "text": "So I want to dive into your first experience was, you said with Ethereum and then through the work of merging one, you've seen all the DeFi apps and you kind of like being involved in that ecosystem. And I'd love to know more about what was the moment that you had this? Was it a light bulb moment where you realized that's actually not the right way to build it and this stuff might be built on Lightning instead. What was that transition like? Because I know these things happened at slightly different times, right? When you first got interested in Ethereum Lightning, it wasn't an industry. So what was that shift like in your head? Well, I think it was definitely gradual. It came after many years of conversations and thinking about these things, and I generally had a pretty open mind, but over time got stuck deeper and deeper into the Bitcoin ecosystem. I think one of my major concerns is all of the sort of defined Ethereum entrepreneurs we spoke with. And this was pretty salon and all that new stuff. I would always kind of just ask, out of curiosity, do you run a full node for your ecosystem and didn't find anyone? That was and that started concerning me. I felt a little bit like Sandra, and I was like, this whole thing in my mind is about having decentralized base layer infrastructure. And if people aren't running nodes or it's too hard or expensive to do that, that seems like a big problem. And then when you realize the cost of running a node is getting more expensive over time because the rate of the blockchain is swelling much faster than the cost of consumer hardware is coming down to run those nodes, seems like the problem is only getting worse. So that was like the first big knock. Second big knock was the transition of proof of stake. And did a lot of research around that very skeptical proof of stake at the base layer. I actually think a theorem would be much better served to stick with proof of work. I think proof of work is the innovation. And that comes from my understanding of this energy backed money concept that I talked about. And the deeper I went on that rabbit hole, the more skeptical I became. A pretty mistake. And then the next big thing was just understanding that bitcoin could scale vertically like the Internet. And I think the big light bulb, the true light bulb moment for me, was realizing, oh my God, history arrives pretty well, and we have almost an exact blueprint for how I think this is going to happen. And that's the Internet, right? So you got TCP IP scaling up to Https and all these application layers. It's not new. And so when that click from Edison, bitcoin is the Internet of value. And why would you ever have a competing chain or settlement layer that is number two? If you have one that is the most secure, that is the most liquid, and the most decentralized, and it's exponentially growing all those fronts, then it's kind of like it reminded me of the old Internet versus information superhighway argument. And you had very smart people like Bill Gates being like, oh, the information is super highway. It's like, that's crazy. Open always wins. And so I see bitcoin as the Internet of money. It's an open system. And when I realized that with the lightning network you could scale to take payments, I was like, okay. I started thinking of it like the Grim Reaper meme, where he goes and knocks on every door. I was like, first bitcoin is coming for money, then it's coming for payments next. When I learned about Tarot, or Tarot, however you say lightning lots coming for stable coins. And I think smart contracts or versions of that will likely come later with covenants, if we ever get there, or something like that. I'm not saying for or against the covenants, but I think in general, my zoomed out investor intuition is everything comes back to bitcoin. It's just a matter of when. Right ",

      "text": "what's the scenario if bitcoin never gets beyond digital gold? What if it doesn't get to the point it actually is a highly used currency. It's always seen as, like a bar of gold or the gun in your drawer. You don't ever want to actually have to use it, but you don't want to not have one. Yes. I think there are two scenarios, maybe three scenarios where this could play out. Right. So the first is, if bitcoin, for some reason, the world decided they didn't want it. Right. And we can get into why that may happen in the future. I don't think it's a high probability, but that would be one is just everyone says, okay, we don't like bitcoin anymore. They move on. Then obviously it never transitions past that. The second is the world says, hey, bitcoin is digital gold. It's very valuable, but we don't want to use it for anything else other than digital gold. And I think that people who view that argument would make a comparison to gold itself. You could almost think of it as, okay, what percentage of people or how much value goes into the gold market today? It's about $10 trillion, give or take. And so maybe it's bitcoin market cap is 10 trillion, and it kind of is equivalent to gold. Maybe it is able to eat into other store value assets, like art or real estate or something like that. Maybe it ends up being more than 10 trillion. But there's some world where Bitcoin is a store of value and it never gets used as a currency itself. And I think that's what would happen there. The third one is actually where I think that we are headed towards, which is Bitcoin, the asset, is used as a store value, which we're obviously seeing. Now, there are people who use it for medium of exchange, but because of the US dollar price volatility, they may want to use stable coins or something else on a more regular basis. But it is still used. Last year it did more transaction volume on chain than Mastercard or whatever. But what we're seeing start to develop is that layer two and potentially layer three technologies are being built on top of Bitcoin, the network. So I always have to remind folks that Bitcoin is one word, but it can have two different meanings. It can be the asset that you hold or it can be the actual technology computing network that is being described. They're both named Bitcoin, which doesn't help conversation. And so in a world where people say, I want to hold bitcoin, the asset, and then we're going to build layer two, layer three on top of it, in some of those situations, you may use Bitcoin for a medium of exchange, the Lightning network, right, you send bitcoin back and forth. But now there is a proposal from Lightning Labs where they want to build something called Tarot. And on Tarot they believe that they'll be able to actually build stable coins and other types of assets that are tied into kind of layer one and layer two. Again, it's a proposal that hasn't been built yet. And so we got to see if it's possible and when will it actually get built and what adoption looks like. But I think those are the three scenarios where Bitcoin ends up being a store of value, but not much more. It's like either nobody wants Bitcoin at all, it's just a store of value and ends up serving like other store values today. Or the third thing is the asset is a store value, but the network and the technology stack ends up being used for other purposes where maybe one of those is stablecoin on top of the security of Bitcoin. And therefore people use that for medium of exchange and Bitcoin as a store of value. Got it. ",

What kind of tasks should people expect when they come to any task besides any task? It's getting that way. It's a shockingly large array of talent. Anything in the creative field. So, for instance, write down from very laborious dull jobs that you'd want to outsource, because even though you could do it or your team could do it, why would you when you can outsource it so cheap? So, for instance, product cutouts, if you've got 500 products to cut out from a background, to give a transparent background, you could outsource that on any task. And you'll find someone who will do 15 or 20 product cut outs for $5 or something crazy, because it's a fairly low skilled job, but it just needs time right up to highly detailed cartoons, animations, so whiteboard explainer videos, voiceovers translations, of course, proofreading and copywriting, logo design, website design, the list goes on. The strangest ones I've seen are things like tarot readings, where they do a video of a tarot reading and there's some really peculiar things, but at the same time there's all the things that you would expect to find and indeed want to outsource. If you were starting a small business or running a small business, you could definitely outsource tons of your design, tons of your social media headers, YouTube, video intros, all that kind of stuff. There's some great people on there making things and they're so much cheaper. If you get a chance, or anyone listening gets a chance, go to News Anytask.com and have a look. Every time we see people that are regular buyers or regular sellers, we do a little case study, we interview them and then we put it on there. And there are some great stories on there anyway, of people whose lives are being touched by this, both as a buyer or a seller. And some of them are quite scientific. I use fiber a lot, for instance, so what I've done is I've moved across to use you. One of the guy says, I find that I can buy the same skill five times cheaper on any task and the people that are doing it are bending over backwards to please me because they want to get that five star review so fraction of the price of our competitors because we're empowering someone and that someone is really pleased to earn that level of money.

And here's what I think needs to happen here's kind of a future I imagine where users truly have a decentralized experience in such that they can just pick whatever LSP works for them is every single wallet. Imagine if every wallet you opened up, you know how you have to back up your keys, like immediately out the gate, you have to store down your 24 words or twelve words, whatever it is. What if every single lightning wallet you had, the very next thing you do is just select your LSP and they all have the absolute most basic advertising for prices. Imagine if you could just see the whole list of all potential non custodial liquidity services and you just had like a rating from other people's rating that they used to say, this is how good this one is. And one of them says, oh, we charge 1% for every new channel, or .1%, or we charge just a flat 2000 SATS for everything you don't have liquidity for, et cetera, whatever. They have a simple pricing mechanism, whether lightning ends up being priced in an interest rate or a percent of payments or a set fee every time a channel and liquidity needs to be provisioned for you. That's the kind of thing that I think the market will sort out as time goes on. Lightning pool, specifically, I think, has it that there's like an upfront fee for a certain amount of liquidity over a certain amount of time. There's all sorts of different models one could use, and if you have a market or access to a group of LSPs in such a way where when you boot up the Zeus wallet, it just asks you in a step, which LSP do you want to pick? And obviously you can just connect to your own node, or you can open up your own channels. You just hit manually or skip, I don't want to use an LSP, but otherwise the majority of users can just be like, I want breeze, yeah, I want async. Oh, I want lightning labs, or I want synonym, because they're doing basically an LSP service too. It's not out yet, but he's recognizing that that's one of the major issues of the network is allocating and sourcing where liquidity needs to be on the network. So my thinking there was that you could basically solve the usability of every single wallet by putting the LSP services in front of everybody who downloads a wallet. That's just kind of a part of the set up process for every wallet. At least it doesn't automatically have an LSP like Breeze, moon, or phoenix. It's not that LSP's actual wallet that they created and then, shit, go ahead and add slash tags into this and the web of trust and that's how you can manage ratings and stuff. I'm going too far. If you haven't read about sending him or listening to any of the episodes with John carvallo or whatever, the chat something, I don't know. It was titled the real Web. Will the real web three please stand up? You got to listen to it. I'm super excited about this. My hope I am. Levels are super high. This seems like such a fascinating project to me. And honestly, one of the immediate use cases that came to my mind was developing a web of trust for lightning nodes, for LSPs to be able to rate and weigh essentially the value of a certain connection and certain liquidity with certain nodes on the network. Now, another thing that Roy brings up in this piece is there's a line he talks about liquidity sitting in a channel somewhere on the network that isn't doing anything, where payments aren't flowing through and a customer isn't using their wallet. They use their wallet once every four months or something is stagnant. It is liquidity that is not producing a yield. So that. Needs to be reallocated. So in the context of the LSP thing, if you're connecting to one of these services or one of these nodes specifically, they could basically have a time span in which they offer up liquidity. And this goes back to the Splicing. And this is also something that would use tap root addresses. I'm getting a little bit technical here and if you're not following along, I'm very sorry, but this is just something I've been thinking about lately. So I wanted to do a show about it.

      "text": "One of the latest experimentations on lightning is Tarot, or Tarot, however we say it. Yeah. I want to get your take on how you think Tarot will evolve and what role it will play in the context of this 200 billion dollar stablecoin market, which is now if we wrap all these stable coins together, they're effectively the second largest crypto asset today. What role does Taro play, do you think? So taro is very early on, right? Like it's basically a spec right now. As far as I know, there isn't any public working quote, and that will probably take time and that's fine. But I think that, first of all, interestingly. There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about what it even is. And Tarot, at the most simple level, it's in addition to the bitcoin base layer, really doesn't require any changes to bitcoin, but it really only requires the main chain to really function is kind of a way for people to settle transactions in other assets that are not bitcoin. Using the bitcoin main layer. And then depending on the type of asset and depending on the liquidity that it has, some of those can be transferred on Lightning as well. And then the question is, what are we going to use this for? Terror doesn't care if it's a stable coin, if it's some weird ponzi shit coin, if it's an NFD, the protocol doesn't care what it is. Lightning cannot transfer NFDS. But on the main layer, it can be whatever it wants to be. But I think that the main use case that has been presented as an example for why we would want to is stable coins. Yeah, as you say, stable coins grew, like unimaginably in the last couple of years, but also in the last five, six years. Definitely more than I think most people expected. I used to think that stablecoins are a very odd idea. I was like, well, why it's still centralized, so why are we using a blockchain for them? They used to use bitcoin for settlement in the past. Theater was originally issued on a protocol called Omni that was using Bitcoin. And I believe the team is like, as we speak, they're working on a way to transfer stable coins on Omni with lightning, which is a separate effort to tarot me, myself. Back in 2016, I was working on another standard that was called Standard. No one was using it, but we hoped it would become a standard for transferring cold coins on top of lightning, with the same idea of doing that for stable coins. And in the process of researching how this was going to work, we eventually gave up that idea. And even though we had a working implementation back in 2016 on Tesla, so we kind of gave up on that idea because we didn't think that lightning necessarily has benefits over using stable coins on other platforms. I want to say in that context, there's this trap that engineers like me often fall into where we say, well, there are two possible solutions, and solution A seems like it's technically inferior to solution B, so solution A has no chance, and that's not how the world works. Sometimes the technically inferior solution does win. So I'm not saying here, oh, stable coins and lightning cannot work. Maybe they will. Maybe they will be very big. But I think that especially for stable coins, when you accept that the stablecoin is going to be centralized, and when you accept that you're going to have trust in the issuer, then the benefits of lightning seem to kind of diminish. I think a lot of people have made a very good point on how using stablecoins on lightning would benefit Lightning and would benefit bitcoin. I kind of agree with those, but I'm not sure if they benefit the stablecoin users, so I'm not sure they're going to come again. We'll see. I'm known to be a very skeptical person, but the reason is I'm a bit skeptical of that is we have very easy ways to use stablecoins today on other platforms. I don't even talk about Ethereum, but if you look at something like Tron, I always bring it up, and people always think I'm joking. But Tron is the number one infrastructure for transferring USDT today, so both in transaction volume and both in just transaction count. So there are more transactions and with bigger volume too. People use it all the time. It's super fast, it's super cheap, like we're talking subset, transaction fees, and of course it's centralized. But why would you care? USD is centralized anyway, right? The main concern that people often bring up is that, well, what happens if Tron is forced to shut down or whatever? And I think the important thing to understand is that even if that happens, the holders of USDT or Tron are not affected because the issuer task can always say, okay, we have the last snapshot of balances at the time that chronicle apps for whatever reason, and we can take that and transfer that to any other chain. So it makes a lot of sense to use the most efficient and the cheapest one at any given time. And then if something happens, we just move to another one. And that seems to be what the market shows as well. So then the question is, why would you want to use Lightning for that? Which is we've all made Lightning payments. We've seen them fail. Even these days, let's say, optimistically, they will fail about five to 10% of. The time, depending on the size. Yeah. And then you need to make sure you have the route, the channels. Why even why go there? Why put stable coins inside a channel, which means you can't use them anywhere else outside of the channel? Why do that? If something like Tron offers you the efficiency of it's yours, you can move them wherever you want. You can do whatever you want with them. You can move them to other chains too. Yeah, I'm not sure that it offers a solution. I feel like we already have a stable coin solution. It's good. Maybe if we did that five years ago, maybe, but now it's difficult, I. Think, for a Lightning node operator. So this is not the user perspective, this would be the perspective of a node operator. I do think there's a lot of similarities between what Taro might enable and what a liquidity provider on Uniswap would get. You're effectively your own exchange. In both examples, like, it's slightly different, you're exchanging things in a different way, your routing rather than swapping assets. Well, you're swapping and routing, but you're passing on a payment to someone else. But it seems like it's effectively going to be a similar outcome for an operator of a node. And I guess then the question is, is there going to be enough demand from consumers to send those payments through to make the node operator successful and actually earn money? Is that your sentiment right now? That the usual constraint. Yeah, mostly. I think it's very true what you say, that this can enable the sort of functionality, but I think it's important to note that it's inferior to what's available on other chains. So, yes, I can be a liquidity provider that tries to take fees out of people converting from USB to BTC and vice versa. But it is kind of capital inefficient because I will have to lock more coins than what I'm willing to probably trade in order to enable that. That's one, two people around me will have to do so. Other people will have to lock coins inside channels that will not even participate in the trade. So it's just less capital efficient. And if it's less capital efficient, that means that fees will probably be higher, and it's just not as fluid as it would be in something like, let's say, Uniswap, which is definitely in the latest inclinations, very focused on capital efficiency and being as cheap to operate as possible. And being cheap to operate means that end users can pay much lower fees. If you cannot compete with fees on something like Unisop, if I'm going to build, like, a product that uses Lightning to convert those to Bitcoin, I'm going to say, well, the fees here are higher, but it's Lightning. I'm not sure it's such a great sell. Like, people will say, well, Unisopot gives me better fees, so I'll probably go there. Push back on that real quick. Because Unisop's V Three, the capital efficiency improvements there, that was only significant because it was very capital inefficient in V Two, right? Yeah. No, that's true. It did get adoption in V Two, right? Like, it did get people to use it while being a capital inefficient solution. Yeah. And I think the reason for that is because there was no alternative before. So here's the problem. In the larger crypto space, people have been building those solutions for, let's say, the last few years. And with Bitcoin, we're starting to catch up from the ground floor. The designs are very primitive compared to what is available today on Uniswap and other DeFi apps or whatever. And it's totally fair that we start from a primitive design. That's okay, that's how you start. But the problem is we started three years late, so we don't exist in a vacuum. We were competing with products that are much more mature now, and it will be very difficult. The problem is that with Lightning, you have to design it from scratch. It's not like if I'm building on Solana, I can take a lot of the concepts that people have already built on Ethereum and adapt them to Solana and start on an equal footing and build from that. But with Lightning, since the designs are completely new, and then we kind of start from the ground floor while everyone else has a three year advantage, that's kind of rough. And you add to that the fact that we know that the designs that you can express with Bitcoin and Lightning are necessarily more limited. Like the amount of possible designs that you can express is more limited. Correct. So it's not an easy point to start from. Now, I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's not easy at all. Again, all we have for Terror right now is the paper. I think that the team at Lightning Labs is amazing, and I think the community around them is amazing, too. So I think that both what they will be able to pull off and the community that I believe will adopt a lot of this, I'm very bullish on what can happen there, but. We also need to be realistic about what we're competing with. It's not easy. And I think probably the path to if I'm putting on my Lightning bull hat, I'm saying, like, the path to winning here, I don't think is a direct competition against what is on other chains. I agree that there's network effects here and that going head on against something like Uniswap has failed for people on that same chain already. Yeah. I don't know why it would be different to do a head on Uniswap competitor on Bitcoin. But where I think we have an opening is in the types of transactions that can't happen on other chains or have not been proven to successfully happened on other chains. And what I mean by that is, like some of these subsent transactions and subdollar transactions, machine to machine transactions, I think there's an economy that is waiting to be tapped into, and maybe Lightning is the solution for that. But I'm pretty confident that now, as you say, when feeds move over to Ethereum for trading, it renders a lot of the microuse cases useless. You can no longer do them there. I think the scalability of Lightning and the peer to peer design might make it the solution for this new class of transactions. And so, in a way, it may not be competing directly against Ethereum or other chains. It may be carving out its own niche using similar technologies like pooling liquidity and swapping assets back and forth. permissionlessly. I think that could be an opening, I guess, for Lightning. Yeah, it can be. I think it can be. And I think it will be very interesting. When I look at the data and I really like the episode you did with man, I forgot his name, the guy from Arcane. Very interesting research about Lightning usage. They've written two reports now. Arcane? Yeah, they have two reports and the later one came out after Square Cash App added support for Lightning deposits and withdrawals. And you can see so I think the most popular, probably, or the most widely deployed Lightning enabled apps are probably roughly something like Cash App, Strike and Shivo in El Salvador. I would imagine that there are probably at least three of the top four. Do you think those are top three in usage as well, or in deployed. With users in enlightening usage? I have no idea. Probably not the top three. They're ",

          "text": "One of the latest experimentations on lightning is Tarot, or Tarot, however we say it. Yeah. I want to get your take on how you think Tarot will evolve and what role it will play in the context of this 200 billion dollar stablecoin market, which is now if we wrap all these stable coins together, they're effectively the second largest crypto asset today. What role does Taro play, do you think? So taro is very early on, right? Like it's basically a spec right now. As far as I know, there isn't any public working quote, and that will probably take time and that's fine. But I think that, first of all, interestingly. There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about what it even is. And Tarot, at the most simple level, it's in addition to the bitcoin base layer, really doesn't require any changes to bitcoin, but it really only requires the main chain to really function is kind of a way for people to settle transactions in other assets that are not bitcoin. Using the bitcoin main layer. And then depending on the type of asset and depending on the liquidity that it has, some of those can be transferred on Lightning as well. And then the question is, what are we going to use this for? Terror doesn't care if it's a stable coin, if it's some weird ponzi shit coin, if it's an NFD, the protocol doesn't care what it is. Lightning cannot transfer NFDS. But on the main layer, it can be whatever it wants to be. But I think that the main use case that has been presented as an example for why we would want to is stable coins. Yeah, as you say, stable coins grew, like unimaginably in the last couple of years, but also in the last five, six years. Definitely more than I think most people expected. I used to think that stablecoins are a very odd idea. I was like, well, why it's still centralized, so why are we using a blockchain for them? They used to use bitcoin for settlement in the past. Theater was originally issued on a protocol called Omni that was using Bitcoin. And I believe the team is like, as we speak, they're working on a way to transfer stable coins on Omni with lightning, which is a separate effort to tarot me, myself. Back in 2016, I was working on another standard that was called Standard. No one was using it, but we hoped it would become a standard for transferring cold coins on top of lightning, with the same idea of doing that for stable coins. And in the process of researching how this was going to work, we eventually gave up that idea. And even though we had a working implementation back in 2016 on Tesla, so we kind of gave up on that idea because we didn't think that lightning necessarily has benefits over using stable coins on other platforms. I want to say in that context, there's this trap that engineers like me often fall into where we say, well, there are two possible solutions, and solution A seems like it's technically inferior to solution B, so solution A has no chance, and that's not how the world works. Sometimes the technically inferior solution does win. So I'm not saying here, oh, stable coins and lightning cannot work. Maybe they will. Maybe they will be very big. But I think that especially for stable coins, when you accept that the stablecoin is going to be centralized, and when you accept that you're going to have trust in the issuer, then the benefits of lightning seem to kind of diminish. I think a lot of people have made a very good point on how using stablecoins on lightning would benefit Lightning and would benefit bitcoin. I kind of agree with those, but I'm not sure if they benefit the stablecoin users, so I'm not sure they're going to come again. We'll see. I'm known to be a very skeptical person, but the reason is I'm a bit skeptical of that is we have very easy ways to use stablecoins today on other platforms. I don't even talk about Ethereum, but if you look at something like Tron, I always bring it up, and people always think I'm joking. But Tron is the number one infrastructure for transferring USDT today, so both in transaction volume and both in just transaction count. So there are more transactions and with bigger volume too. People use it all the time. It's super fast, it's super cheap, like we're talking subset, transaction fees, and of course it's centralized. But why would you care? USD is centralized anyway, right? The main concern that people often bring up is that, well, what happens if Tron is forced to shut down or whatever? And I think the important thing to understand is that even if that happens, the holders of USDT or Tron are not affected because the issuer task can always say, okay, we have the last snapshot of balances at the time that chronicle apps for whatever reason, and we can take that and transfer that to any other chain. So it makes a lot of sense to use the most efficient and the cheapest one at any given time. And then if something happens, we just move to another one. And that seems to be what the market shows as well. So then the question is, why would you want to use Lightning for that? Which is we've all made Lightning payments. We've seen them fail. Even these days, let's say, optimistically, they will fail about five to 10% of. The time, depending on the size. Yeah. And then you need to make sure you have the route, the channels. Why even why go there? Why put stable coins inside a channel, which means you can't use them anywhere else outside of the channel? Why do that? If something like Tron offers you the efficiency of it's yours, you can move them wherever you want. You can do whatever you want with them. You can move them to other chains too. Yeah, I'm not sure that it offers a solution. I feel like we already have a stable coin solution. It's good. Maybe if we did that five years ago, maybe, but now it's difficult, I. Think, for a Lightning node operator. So this is not the user perspective, this would be the perspective of a node operator. I do think there's a lot of similarities between what Taro might enable and what a liquidity provider on Uniswap would get. You're effectively your own exchange. In both examples, like, it's slightly different, you're exchanging things in a different way, your routing rather than swapping assets. Well, you're swapping and routing, but you're passing on a payment to someone else. But it seems like it's effectively going to be a similar outcome for an operator of a node. And I guess then the question is, is there going to be enough demand from consumers to send those payments through to make the node operator successful and actually earn money? Is that your sentiment right now? That the usual constraint. Yeah, mostly. I think it's very true what you say, that this can enable the sort of functionality, but I think it's important to note that it's inferior to what's available on other chains. So, yes, I can be a liquidity provider that tries to take fees out of people converting from USB to BTC and vice versa. But it is kind of capital inefficient because I will have to lock more coins than what I'm willing to probably trade in order to enable that. That's one, two people around me will have to do so. Other people will have to lock coins inside channels that will not even participate in the trade. So it's just less capital efficient. And if it's less capital efficient, that means that fees will probably be higher, and it's just not as fluid as it would be in something like, let's say, Uniswap, which is definitely in the latest inclinations, very focused on capital efficiency and being as cheap to operate as possible. And being cheap to operate means that end users can pay much lower fees. If you cannot compete with fees on something like Unisop, if I'm going to build, like, a product that uses Lightning to convert those to Bitcoin, I'm going to say, well, the fees here are higher, but it's Lightning. I'm not sure it's such a great sell. Like, people will say, well, Unisopot gives me better fees, so I'll probably go there. Push back on that real quick. Because Unisop's V Three, the capital efficiency improvements there, that was only significant because it was very capital inefficient in V Two, right? Yeah. No, that's true. It did get adoption in V Two, right? Like, it did get people to use it while being a capital inefficient solution. Yeah. And I think the reason for that is because there was no alternative before. So here's the problem. In the larger crypto space, people have been building those solutions for, let's say, the last few years. And with Bitcoin, we're starting to catch up from the ground floor. The designs are very primitive compared to what is available today on Uniswap and other DeFi apps or whatever. And it's totally fair that we start from a primitive design.

      "text": "How will we bring more defy to Bitcoin in a way that's consistent with Bitcoin scalability goals? I mean, you don't need all these scammy tokens. Every DeFi project seems to have one in order to attract more people. So if you don't have scammy tokens, then I think it's pretty legit. The thing is, it's not nearly as popular without some token because people like speculating on tokens and it helps out the people that are building it because they can essentially print their own money. There's already stuff like Atomic Finance who are doing Bitcoin back loans or Bitcoin options and things like that, so it's entirely possible. But the thing you have to realize is that if you don't have a token and all these marketing dollars behind it, you're not going to have nearly the same amount of popularity. How would tap Root affect Bitcoin and Lightning also for general use, like in El Salvador? Well, lightning already works, and that's because SegWit takes away transaction malleability. What tap root does is it adds signatures, which means that you can have channel openings that aren't obviously channel openings. With pay to witness script hash, it's very clear that what you're doing is opening a channel because it's a two of two with Snore, it gives you a little more Privacy. People don't know necessarily that it's the channel open. That's a very good thing, because if a miner can't tell that it's a lightning close or something like that, then they can't necessarily discriminate against it and so on, which no doubt could happen in some capacity. What would be a simple example or examples of things that we might want programmed onto Bitcoin? And are there more complex things that you need a team of or volunteers to start working on for the betterment of the code or the community? I think we've got a lot of the features. Tap Root, obviously, is a pretty nice upgrade. Something like Cross Input Signature Aggregation is also a nice upgrade. Let's see. Yeah, there's probably some more complex things that are coming down the pike, but it isn't for the lack of ideas that Bitcoin doesn't add certain features. It's more because we prioritize security. You can add all kinds of features. But if it doesn't get used, then it was kind of a waste of time. Right. And if it's not used in the way that you think, then you might end up creating all sorts of bad incentives and so on. All right, let's see. I heard on Peter McCormick show that Shinobi said another update had to be done to Bitcoin after Tap route to allow lightning to fill the hoax we have for it, assuming it's true, can you explain that update would be, and how likely you see that to getting implemented eventually? I think he's talking about, say, cash any prevout. Essentially, it allows you to sign for something with a different previous output that is a different input and so on. I think that means that you can switch out the UTXO you're using and essentially upgrade the channel as needed, something like that. It's probably one of the three or four different softwares that are on dock for the next Softwork after Taproot. The others would be Cross Input Signature Aggregation, Op, CTV, and I can't remember the last one, but there's a bunch of them that are possible as sort of like the next thing. Let's see. Well, greater awareness of the Wyikoff method. I don't know what that is more on. Tap root, please. Well, I mean, if you don't understand tap root, it's a bunch of different things that are coming in at the same time. So you have this tap root tree, which is essentially 32 bites that are encoded in a BC one Q address. And it essentially makes it impossible to tell whether it's a single sick key or a multi SIG key or something more complicated. And that's a very good thing. And you can have essentially backup of the amount that you have. Basically, if you have a wallet, you can back it up with three or three of your friends helping you out or something like that. And that's a very good thing. The ability to back something up is kind of what you want. Do you think speedy trial will be the standard process for us in the future? Is there any drawback on this process? Also any downside or trade off on Taproot? You don't have to use it if you don't want to. So no real downside there, because if there was a downside, you just use the older SegWit or something else. This wasn't a user activated software. The miners actually decided to signal for it. So we're above 90% at this point, and it will probably lock in sometime on Friday. And that's a good thing. The current process, I don't think, will necessarily be the standard going forward, and that's okay. I think every software needs its own sort of process because things change. All right. Hi, Jimmy. Cross input signature aggregation. All right, so maybe I should explain what that is, because this is one of the really nice things about store signatures that we're eventually going to get, hopefully. So what is it? Cross input signature aggregation is the ability to aggregate signatures. Now, what does that mean? Right now, when you do a multi SIG and you have like two of three or something like that, you have to have two separate signatures, each one being like 70 bytes or something like that. With Schnor, what you can do is you can have a taprootry of each of two of two of those keys. And what you do is whichever path you end up taking, that's the one that you use. And you only see one signature because the signature is going to be aggregated and the pub keys can be aggregated. So you see one Pub key and one signature. Now, what does cross input means? So say you're spending from five inputs. Even with Snore, what you end up doing is you have to have at least one signature and one pubkey per input. And that kind of sucks because you can also aggregate those. And that's, I think where we're headed. And among other things, that means that if you have like 20 inputs, you only still need one signature. So you can amortize the cost of various of that block space over lots and lots of inputs, which means that there's now an incentive to coin join. You can have lots of people get into this coin join, and when you do, you essentially make it so that every single person gets to be a part of a large transaction. And that means you're saving some blocks space because you only have one signature for this one giant transaction and you have the ability to coin join, like sort of. Naturally, every exchange is going to want to do this because it would be in the best interests of their customers to pay less fees and so on, and I imagine they'll be the ones running these giant coin joins to make that happen. So that's probably coming up in the next software. But that's something to think about, how the UX of wallet and exchanges can help new users. User experience is always kind of a tricky thing. You know, it when you see something good, but it's hard to know what will be good beforehand. And some exchanges have better UX's than others. Obviously, they do a lot of like usability testing and AB testing to make that work. But yeah, I mean, it's hard to say that new users necessarily are easy to write software for. Is Lightning ready? Yeah. So Bitcoin Beach and El Salvador is using it. I think a lot of people are missing the fact that El Salvador already had a big Bitcoin community. And really this action by the President is securing what's already there so that it's easier for their people. And really this is what a good government should do is to secure things that people have already built and not take them away. I'd love for you to talk about the problems of Bitcoin and ways of fixing them in the future. The only thing is really kind of Privacy, and I think you get that with cross input signature aggregation, so that's about it. I think the rest of it works just fine. I know all Coiners like to say that their coin fixes something, but really it's an excuse to print money. What role does tap root play in furthering Bitcoin adoption beginner level? I'm not sure if it necessarily well, actually, no, I take that back. So tap root does allow you to essentially have a backup of every UTXO, so you can have something like three of three of your friends that can help you recover your coin if you lose everything, like your backup seat and your phone wallet that use it or something like that. So, yeah, I think it would help because you can have some sort of natural backup so you can have custody, but also make it so that you have some way of getting it back should you lose everything like a safety net, but not as centralized as government safety nets are confidential transaction status timeline. I don't know if that's something that we're really going to get in Bitcoin. Is Lightning ready for El Salvador? Yes. As I said, it's already being used at Bitcoin Beach. Can the US still tax Bitcoin as a property now that it's a currency for another country? So this is an interesting question. Some people are saying that because it's a recognized legal tender in another country that it has to be treated as a foreign currency, in which case it would have sort of like the same rules as a currency and maybe we don't get taxed on it quite like the capital gain taxes that we have, but it's hard to tell what are the tax implications of all of us now that the US is forced to treat Bitcoin as a foreign currency? I'm not sure if the US will, but I mean, legally they probably have to, but they'll find a way around it to deny it to us if they want to. A more technical discussion of proof of work versus proof of sake. There's not really much more of a technical discussion than okay. Proof of work is finding a hash that's below a certain number. Proof of stake is a bunch of signatures from some select group of people. That's it. That's the difference. One is a bunch of signatures. One is actual computation used to find something that is sufficiently small. Proof of work requires a lot more energy, so it's a lot more secure. Proof of stake is lots of signatures, which isn't secure at all because you can generate signatures anytime you want, as long as the participants are willing. Proof of stake is not that different than the US dollar. I mean, you go look at the dollar and there's a couple of signatures on there usually like Secretary of the treasury or something like that, and somebody else. It's kind of ridiculous that people make that as if it's like a deep philosophical discussion and not something technical. The technical aspect of it is that one requires lots of electricity, the other just requires signatures. Signatures are super easy and they don't provide any security whatsoever. Bib 118 I haven't seen it, so I can't comment on it. What really happened to this FBI thing? Can Bitcoin be hacked? So you have to understand, like government organizations, they generally want to look good. That's why they put out press releases, period. It's some guys ego trip. Whenever you see a Press release, they think like 40 different people and it's because everybody wants a credit because their government jobs don't provide much fulfillment. This is one of the few times that you can actually go do something. So they put out claims that obviously weren't true. You can't quote unquote hack Bitcoin, or just go grab private keys. If they kept it on a cloud server, then these people really didn't know what they were doing. But they make outlandish claims. And you should really look at any government press release with the same skeptical eye that you are with this one regarding Bitcoin, because they don't really tell the truth. They just want to look good and whatever makes them look good, they're going to say, I just want to know what the brand name of your hat? It's Stetson, although I do have one from Texas Hatters down in Lockhart. Absolutely. The most gorgeous SATS. The one that I paid a lot of money for when Bitcoin hit $10,000 has a Beaver pelt brim and a straw top. It's called a half breed, and the idea is that it keeps you cool during the summer because of the straw on top. And the Beaver pelt keeps the rain away. So pretty awesome hat, even if I paid a lot of money for it. All right, what do you expect? The first practical improvements for the regular user of Bitcoin will be after tip tap root activates. I've answered this question a few times, but basically you're going to have the ability to back it up in some way with maybe friends that know what they're doing a little better. So you can do three of your friends that will help you recover your coins should you lose everything. Update your hardware wallet regularly to access your coins or toss the old and buy a new wallet to access your coins in the future, I generally recommend some sort of multi six set up, so that's what I do, and you can swap them out as the hardware wallets improve. Can you explain how game theory is used to keep the network secure? Game theory is just sort of like a fancy way of saying some form of incentives. The incentives on the Bitcoin network are pretty darn good in the sense that if you want to attack the Bitcoin network, it's going to cost you a lot of money, especially versus just mining honestly, in which case you're going to make a lot of money, and that's a good thing. I would say that at a high level. That's essential answer. Applications of DeFi. Is it really needed? I really don't think so. People are like, hey, but you can do loans or whatever. Yeah, you don't need a scamming token, though. You can do loans. I don't know how useful that is. Most people get loans on their Bitcoins so they can buy more Bitcoin or something like that, in which case you're just leveraging and you can go do that at bid Max or whatever. I don't recommend it because generally people that get some of these leverage things kind of get wrecked whenever there's a big price move. All right. When Moon? I think maybe later this year. All right, can we have a permissionless financial system on Bitcoin without KYC? How would that look like we already kind of do. You can go buy Bitcoin using like hotel, hotel or local Bitcoins and not have it recorded anywhere, and that's a good thing. You might have to pay a little bit of a premium, but no KYC checks required. What is proof of transfer or proof of X? I don't know what that is. Do you expect a hostile reaction by stakeholders in the legacy financial system against the move of President Buckley? You know, I don't think so, because a lot of these current stakeholders have to deal with a lot of weird incentives kind of coming into their part of the world right now. If you think about it, banks are not really making money off of savings, right? Like they're paying you 0.5% on your money because they're getting maybe 0.1%. They're like not making any money at all off of your savings. They're also not making money off of loans because it's like two or 3%. In Europe, it's negative. If it's negative, you're definitely not making money. If it's like two or 3%. It's a very tiny amount, at least relative to what it used to be. They have their own problems to deal with and I don't think they'll be paying attention too much to what's going on with El Salvador. All right. Power assumption from Bitcoin is getting more attention after Tesla bought Bitcoin in a bad way. After all, 21 million. Will the power usage be stopped or decreased? Hard to say. It depends on the fees that people are willing to pay. And if it's significant, then I imagine people will be all of these miners will make a relatively decent amount of money. Where can one get a job if he or she knows the Bitcoin core code really well? Certainly a lot of Bitcoin companies like river and Swan and Cash app, probably a lot of exchanges, a lot of custodial services, Unchained capital. Yeah, a lot of different places. All right, let's see. How do you anticipate the IMF to respond, react to what happened in El Salvador? Yeah, it's a good question. I don't really know. I haven't studied the IMF sort of like demands too much. I do know that they wanted to have sort of like a neutral global currency and the special drawing rights, which really doesn't mean anything, but. Yeah, I don't know. They might be hostile. It's hard to say. Soft or hard tacos. I don't need tacos. Sorry. All right, let's see. Okay. How come the charts are not up while Elon just tweeted something from the tweet? The markets changed. Yeah, I think we're in a mini slump and it doesn't matter what news comes. Momentum is kind of powerful. It might be on its way back up again. Before it was even bad news caused Bitcoin to go up. So hard to say. How does Topper help me? I answered this already. For Coinbase users who want to use Lightning network, how would you suggest they convert BTC to Btcln to start using it? I think you're not understanding Lightning. You can open a Lightning wallet and fund it directly from Coinbase. So you can send your Bitcoins from Coinbase to your Lightning wallet and it'll open one or more channels using the money that's in your Lightning wallet and then you can essentially use the Lightning network right away. What is your opinion on dry chains? I think it's an interesting idea. Things in Bitcoin just take a really long time. I know Paul Stork has been working on this for a very long time, but. Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to say. I haven't studied it too closely. Alright. All right. Segwit was the last block size upgrade in 2017. Is it time to create a speedy trial for two X blocks? No, I don't think you understand that lightning is the scaling layer and that's what people are using already, especially in El Salvador when tap route. So that will be around mid November is when we're expecting it. Hi Jimmy, big fan here. I was wondering what is the safest way to save BTC? Really don't feel the Nano ledger? Yeah, I don't think you should use Nano ledger either. I would say the Specter do it yourself wallet Cobo vault the Bitcoin only firmware and cold card. If you're technically savvy enough, use that with the specter wallet and that will pretty much give you everything you need. Do you coin join and if so, which method do you use? I don't use coin join, mostly because it's very annoying to use. With El Salvadorians starting to use Bitcoin as a unit of account, how do you see them pricing their goods and services? I imagine their prices will continually fluctuate. In a pre hyper bitcoinized world, I don't think they're going to use it as a unit of account. I think they'll probably use dollars and what they'll do is just pay the dollar amount in lightning. So the guy that gave this presentation was Jack Maulers and he's of course from Strike. And it makes it very easy to send dollars via lightning to another wallet. So I think that's probably the direction that they're going to go. And not necessarily use Bitcoin as the unit of account, at least not yet. What happens to the Bitcoin? The US government keeps confiscating the Bitcoin from Silk Road. They usually get auctioned off by the US Marshalls. So Tim Draper famously bought most of them from the Silk Road. There's other people that buy it for other reasons. Have we bought them? I don't know. That's a very good question. Delta between liquid and lightning. I think lightning is a little faster. Liquid has confidential transactions, so those are the main differences. I would say. Is Monero safer for illegal activities? I don't know. What do you think of the stacks? I'm not going to answer a short question. What's the next step after capru? I gave the answers earlier, but probably cross and put signature aggregation. Any prevaut or opsity TV. If you can only open one lightning channel, who would you connect to and why? I would probably connect to more than one, but probably some well connected node. Maybe Bitfinex or something like that. What could have the FBI done technically to get Bitcoin from hackers? Yeah, I think their stories BS did well. Salvador give a legal definition of the word. Yeah, you're not really making sense with that question. Tell us about your interactions with the Talc, Buterin and how lame he was. Yeah. I mean, he's just not a very good coder and people act like he's some brilliant wonderkind, like any other College graduate, has lots of ideas on how to make things awesome, and then they try coding it and they fall on their face, except with Vitalik. He doesn't fall on his face because he's printing his own money to cover whatever mistakes he's made. So I feel kind of bad for him because I think he could have been a decent software engineer had he gone down that path. Instead, nontechnical people seem to, like worship him as a deity because they're not technical enough to know that what he says is mostly kind of stupid. But yeah, he's not a very good software engineer and you can tell by the way Ethereum is designed. Can you explain tap rude in a dumb down way? And what's next? Yeah, I already answered that. Why aren't Stablecoins issued on or on top of the Bitcoin network yet? I mean, it kind of was. Heather was for a long time on the Omni protocol, which was on top of Bitcoin. Then they moved to Ethereum, now they're on Tron, and I think on Liquid as well. You can do it, but generally Bitcoin is on a going to be courting you to put your stuff on their network because they're using it for Bitcoin. What's the difference between engineers like Satoshi, Jack Mullers, and you, and between thinkers like Vitalik, Buter. Well, I would say that there's probably more respect for stuff that's been hardened, at least for Satoshi. This is clear when you look at the protocol. Satoshi used some part, like their signatures, for example, distinguished encoder rules or something like that. He used something that was kind of heavy handed and had like seven extra bites. But he did it because it was hardened. A lot of people knew it and there were already libraries to check it and so on. And that's what he used. Whereas Vitalik thinks that if it wasn't invented here, then it's no good and he needs to make his own. And of course, he makes insane stupid mistakes like having no checksum and addresses another BTC mining ban in China right now. I mean, that's kind of already happened. And a lot of that hashing power is moving out of China as we speak. Probably a lot of it is coming to North America. Yeah, we'll be seeing what's going to happen with that. All right, so those were the questions on Twitter. Let's see if I had any on what's wrong with vegetables. That's funny. Well, the thing that's wrong with vegetables is that they really don't provide that much nutrition. Most of it is fiber, and our bodies don't know how to process fiber. If your body wants to process fiber, then you're going to essentially be like a cow which has four stomachs and choose 18 hours a day. We're not cows and we don't have four Sonics and we don't chew 18 hours a day. Most of that just goes right through us. So it doesn't have that much nutrition, period. Alright, let's see if there's any on LinkedIn. Yeah, nothing on LinkedIn. Nothing on YouTube. All right, so there we go. All right, so let's pull up some people. Please raise your hand if you want to ask a question and I will bring you up and you can ask a question except flow there you go. Yeah. What's up overflow the way these things work is that you need enough senators and congressmen to sort of push for it possibly a President and honestly this administration is probably not really that into Bitcoin and I don't see them expending their political capital to do that. So you have to kind of make it worth their while and this is sort of like the dirtiness of politics is that you get what you pay for. So in order to make it worthwhile you have to throw some money around. You have to donate to a lot of campaigns and say, hey, you know what? This is my one issue. You get this done and I'll keep the money flowing. At some point we might want to do that but I don't know many of us in this community being libertarian. I don't think that way is necessarily something we see as that honorable. I think eventually we get that anyway. But yeah, it requires a lot of money being thrown around, a lot of lobbying and so on. All right. Anyone else with a question? If we don't have any more questions then I think we are done with this episode. Thanks. Thanks for listening and hopefully you got something out of all the questions that are answered anyway. Fiat Delinda the song is done. ",

          "text": "How will we bring more defy to Bitcoin in a way that's consistent with Bitcoin scalability goals? I mean, you don't need all these scammy tokens. Every DeFi project seems to have one in order to attract more people. So if you don't have scammy tokens, then I think it's pretty legit. The thing is, it's not nearly as popular without some token because people like speculating on tokens and it helps out the people that are building it because they can essentially print their own money. There's already stuff like Atomic Finance who are doing Bitcoin back loans or Bitcoin options and things like that, so it's entirely possible. But the thing you have to realize is that if you don't have a token and all these marketing dollars behind it, you're not going to have nearly the same amount of popularity. How would tap Root affect Bitcoin and Lightning also for general use, like in El Salvador? Well, lightning already works, and that's because SegWit takes away transaction malleability. What tap root does is it adds signatures, which means that you can have channel openings that aren't obviously channel openings. With pay to witness script hash, it's very clear that what you're doing is opening a channel because it's a two of two with Snore, it gives you a little more Privacy. People don't know necessarily that it's the channel open. That's a very good thing, because if a miner can't tell that it's a lightning close or something like that, then they can't necessarily discriminate against it and so on, which no doubt could happen in some capacity. What would be a simple example or examples of things that we might want programmed onto Bitcoin? And are there more complex things that you need a team of or volunteers to start working on for the betterment of the code or the community? I think we've got a lot of the features. Tap Root, obviously, is a pretty nice upgrade. Something like Cross Input Signature Aggregation is also a nice upgrade. Let's see. Yeah, there's probably some more complex things that are coming down the pike, but it isn't for the lack of ideas that Bitcoin doesn't add certain features. It's more because we prioritize security. You can add all kinds of features. But if it doesn't get used, then it was kind of a waste of time. Right. And if it's not used in the way that you think, then you might end up creating all sorts of bad incentives and so on. All right, let's see. I heard on Peter McCormick show that Shinobi said another update had to be done to Bitcoin after Tap route to allow lightning to fill the hoax we have for it, assuming it's true, can you explain that update would be, and how likely you see that to getting implemented eventually? I think he's talking about, say, cash any prevout. Essentially, it allows you to sign for something with a different previous output that is a different input and so on. I think that means that you can switch out the UTXO you're using and essentially upgrade the channel as needed, something like that. It's probably one of the three or four different softwares that are on dock for the next Softwork after Taproot. The others would be Cross Input Signature Aggregation, Op, CTV, and I can't remember the last one, but there's a bunch of them that are possible as sort of like the next thing. Let's see. Well, greater awareness of the Wyikoff method. I don't know what that is more on. Tap root, please. Well, I mean, if you don't understand tap root, it's a bunch of different things that are coming in at the same time. So you have this tap root tree, which is essentially 32 bites that are encoded in a BC one Q address. And it essentially makes it impossible to tell whether it's a single sick key or a multi SIG key or something more complicated. And that's a very good thing. And you can have essentially backup of the amount that you have. Basically, if you have a wallet, you can back it up with three or three of your friends helping you out or something like that. And that's a very good thing. The ability to back something up is kind of what you want. Do you think speedy trial will be the standard process for us in the future? Is there any drawback on this process? Also any downside or trade off on Taproot? You don't have to use it if you don't want to. So no real downside there, because if there was a downside, you just use the older SegWit or something else. This wasn't a user activated software. The miners actually decided to signal for it. So we're above 90% at this point, and it will probably lock in sometime on Friday. And that's a good thing. The current process, I don't think, will necessarily be the standard going forward, and that's okay. I think every software needs its own sort of process because things change. All right. Hi, Jimmy. Cross input signature aggregation. All right, so maybe I should explain what that is, because this is one of the really nice things about store signatures that we're eventually going to get, hopefully. So what is it? Cross input signature aggregation is the ability to aggregate signatures. Now, what does that mean? Right now, when you do a multi SIG and you have like two of three or something like that, you have to have two separate signatures, each one being like 70 bytes or something like that. With Schnor, what you can do is you can have a taprootry of each of two of two of those keys. And what you do is whichever path you end up taking, that's the one that you use. And you only see one signature because the signature is going to be aggregated and the pub keys can be aggregated. So you see one Pub key and one signature. Now, what does cross input means? So say you're spending from five inputs. Even with Snore, what you end up doing is you have to have at least one signature and one pubkey per input. And that kind of sucks because you can also aggregate those. And that's, I think where we're headed. And among other things, that means that if you have like 20 inputs, you only still need one signature. So you can amortize the cost of various of that block space over lots and lots of inputs, which means that there's now an incentive to coin join. You can have lots of people get into this coin join, and when you do, you essentially make it so that every single person gets to be a part of a large transaction. And that means you're saving some blocks space because you only have one signature for this one giant transaction and you have the ability to coin join, like sort of. Naturally, every exchange is going to want to do this because it would be in the best interests of their customers to pay less fees and so on, and I imagine they'll be the ones running these giant coin joins to make that happen. So that's probably coming up in the next software. But that's something to think about, how the UX of wallet and exchanges can help new users. User experience is always kind of a tricky thing. You know, it when you see something good, but it's hard to know what will be good beforehand. And some exchanges have better UX's than others. Obviously, they do a lot of like usability testing and AB testing to make that work. But yeah, I mean, it's hard to say that new users necessarily are easy to write software for. Is Lightning ready? Yeah. So Bitcoin Beach and El Salvador is using it. I think a lot of people are missing the fact that El Salvador already had a big Bitcoin community. And really this action by the President is securing what's already there so that it's easier for their people. And really this is what a good government should do is to secure things that people have already built and not take them away. I'd love for you to talk about the problems of Bitcoin and ways of fixing them in the future. The only thing is really kind of Privacy, and I think you get that with cross input signature aggregation, so that's about it. I think the rest of it works just fine. I know all Coiners like to say that their coin fixes something, but really it's an excuse to print money. What role does tap root play in furthering Bitcoin adoption beginner level? I'm not sure if it necessarily well, actually, no, I take that back. So tap root does allow you to essentially have a backup of every UTXO, so you can have something like three of three of your friends that can help you recover your coin if you lose everything, like your backup seat and your phone wallet that use it or something like that. So, yeah, I think it would help because you can have some sort of natural backup so you can have custody, but also make it so that you have some way of getting it back should you lose everything like a safety net, but not as centralized as government safety nets are confidential transaction status timeline. I don't know if that's something that we're really going to get in Bitcoin. Is Lightning ready for El Salvador? Yes. As I said, it's already being used at Bitcoin Beach. Can the US still tax Bitcoin as a property now that it's a currency for another country? So this is an interesting question. Some people are saying that because it's a recognized legal tender in another country that it has to be treated as a foreign currency, in which case it would have sort of like the same rules as a currency and maybe we don't get taxed on it quite like the capital gain taxes that we have, but it's hard to tell what are the tax implications of all of us now that the US is forced to treat Bitcoin as a foreign currency? I'm not sure if the US will, but I mean, legally they probably have to, but they'll find a way around it to deny it to us if they want to. A more technical discussion of proof of work versus proof of sake. There's not really much more of a technical discussion than okay. Proof of work is finding a hash that's below a certain number. Proof of stake is a bunch of signatures from some select group of people. That's it. That's the difference. One is a bunch of signatures. One is actual computation used to find something that is sufficiently small. Proof of work requires a lot more energy, so it's a lot more secure. Proof of stake is lots of signatures, which isn't secure at all because you can generate signatures anytime you want, as long as the participants are willing. Proof of stake is not that different than the US dollar. I mean, you go look at the dollar and there's a couple of signatures on there usually like Secretary of the treasury or something like that, and somebody else. It's kind of ridiculous that people make that as if it's like a deep philosophical discussion and not something technical. The technical aspect of it is that one requires lots of electricity, the other just requires signatures. Signatures are super easy and they don't provide any security whatsoever. Bib 118 I haven't seen it, so I can't comment on it. What really happened to this FBI thing? Can Bitcoin be hacked? So you have to understand, like government organizations, they generally want to look good. That's why they put out press releases, period. It's some guys ego trip. Whenever you see a Press release, they think like 40 different people and it's because everybody wants a credit because their government jobs don't provide much fulfillment. This is one of the few times that you can actually go do something. So they put out claims that obviously weren't true. You can't quote unquote hack Bitcoin, or just go grab private keys. If they kept it on a cloud server, then these people really didn't know what they were doing. But they make outlandish claims. And you should really look at any government press release with the same skeptical eye that you are with this one regarding Bitcoin, because they don't really tell the truth. They just want to look good and whatever makes them look good, they're going to say, I just want to know what the brand name of your hat? It's Stetson, although I do have one from Texas Hatters down in Lockhart. Absolutely. The most gorgeous SATS. The one that I paid a lot of money for when Bitcoin hit $10,000 has a Beaver pelt brim and a straw top. It's called a half breed, and the idea is that it keeps you cool during the summer because of the straw on top. And the Beaver pelt keeps the rain away. So pretty awesome hat, even if I paid a lot of money for it. All right, what do you expect? The first practical improvements for the regular user of Bitcoin will be after tip tap root activates. I've answered this question a few times, but basically you're going to have the ability to back it up in some way with maybe friends that know what they're doing a little better. So you can do three of your friends that will help you recover your coins should you lose everything. Update your hardware wallet regularly to access your coins or toss the old and buy a new wallet to access your coins in the future, I generally recommend some sort of multi six set up, so that's what I do, and you can swap them out as the hardware wallets improve. Can you explain how game theory is used to keep the network secure? Game theory is just sort of like a fancy way of saying some form of incentives. The incentives on the Bitcoin network are pretty darn good in the sense that if you want to attack the Bitcoin network, it's going to cost you a lot of money, especially versus just mining honestly, in which case you're going to make a lot of money, and that's a good thing. I would say that at a high level. That's essential answer. Applications of DeFi. Is it really needed? I really don't think so. People are like, hey, but you can do loans or whatever. Yeah, you don't need a scamming token, though. You can do loans. I don't know how useful that is. Most people get loans on their Bitcoins so they can buy more Bitcoin or something like that, in which case you're just leveraging and you can go do that at bid Max or whatever. I don't recommend it because generally people that get some of these leverage things kind of get wrecked whenever there's a big price move. All right. When Moon? I think maybe later this year. All right, can we have a permissionless financial system on Bitcoin without KYC? How would that look like we already kind of do. You can go buy Bitcoin using like hotel, hotel or local Bitcoins and not have it recorded anywhere, and that's a good thing. You might have to pay a little bit of a premium, but no KYC checks required. What is proof of transfer or proof of X? I don't know what that is. Do you expect a hostile reaction by stakeholders in the legacy financial system against the move of President Buckley?

They have their own problems to deal with and I don't think they'll be paying attention too much to what's going on with El Salvador. All right. Power assumption from Bitcoin is getting more attention after Tesla bought Bitcoin in a bad way. After all, 21 million. Will the power usage be stopped or decreased? Hard to say. It depends on the fees that people are willing to pay. And if it's significant, then I imagine people will be all of these miners will make a relatively decent amount of money. Where can one get a job if he or she knows the Bitcoin core code really well? Certainly a lot of Bitcoin companies like river and Swan and Cash app, probably a lot of exchanges, a lot of custodial services, Unchained capital. Yeah, a lot of different places. All right, let's see. How do you anticipate the IMF to respond, react to what happened in El Salvador? Yeah, it's a good question. I don't really know. I haven't studied the IMF sort of like demands too much. I do know that they wanted to have sort of like a neutral global currency and the special drawing rights, which really doesn't mean anything, but. Yeah, I don't know. They might be hostile. It's hard to say. Soft or hard tacos. I don't need tacos. Sorry. All right, let's see. Okay. How come the charts are not up while Elon just tweeted something from the tweet? The markets changed. Yeah, I think we're in a mini slump and it doesn't matter what news comes. Momentum is kind of powerful. It might be on its way back up again. Before it was even bad news caused Bitcoin to go up. So hard to say. How does Topper help me? I answered this already. For Coinbase users who want to use Lightning network, how would you suggest they convert BTC to Btcln to start using it? I think you're not understanding Lightning. You can open a Lightning wallet and fund it directly from Coinbase. So you can send your Bitcoins from Coinbase to your Lightning wallet and it'll open one or more channels using the money that's in your Lightning wallet and then you can essentially use the Lightning network right away. What is your opinion on dry chains? I think it's an interesting idea. Things in Bitcoin just take a really long time. I know Paul Stork has been working on this for a very long time, but. Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to say. I haven't studied it too closely. Alright. All right. Segwit was the last block size upgrade in 2017. Is it time to create a speedy trial for two X blocks? No, I don't think you understand that lightning is the scaling layer and that's what people are using already, especially in El Salvador when tap route. So that will be around mid November is when we're expecting it. Hi Jimmy, big fan here. I was wondering what is the safest way to save BTC? Really don't feel the Nano ledger? Yeah, I don't think you should use Nano ledger either. I would say the Specter do it yourself wallet Cobo vault the Bitcoin only firmware and cold card. If you're technically savvy enough, use that with the specter wallet and that will pretty much give you everything you need. Do you coin join and if so, which method do you use? I don't use coin join, mostly because it's very annoying to use. With El Salvadorians starting to use Bitcoin as a unit of account, how do you see them pricing their goods and services? I imagine their prices will continually fluctuate. In a pre hyper bitcoinized world, I don't think they're going to use it as a unit of account. I think they'll probably use dollars and what they'll do is just pay the dollar amount in lightning. So the guy that gave this presentation was Jack Maulers and he's of course from Strike. And it makes it very easy to send dollars via lightning to another wallet. So I think that's probably the direction that they're going to go. And not necessarily use Bitcoin as the unit of account, at least not yet. What happens to the Bitcoin? The US government keeps confiscating the Bitcoin from Silk Road. They usually get auctioned off by the US Marshalls. So Tim Draper famously bought most of them from the Silk Road. There's other people that buy it for other reasons. Have we bought them? I don't know. That's a very good question. Delta between liquid and lightning. I think lightning is a little faster. Liquid has confidential transactions, so those are the main differences. I would say. Is Monero safer for illegal activities? I don't know. What do you think of the stacks? I'm not going to answer a short question. What's the next step after capru? I gave the answers earlier, but probably cross and put signature aggregation. Any prevaut or opsity TV. If you can only open one lightning channel, who would you connect to and why? I would probably connect to more than one, but probably some well connected node. Maybe Bitfinex or something like that. What could have the FBI done technically to get Bitcoin from hackers? Yeah, I think their stories BS did well. Salvador give a legal definition of the word. Yeah, you're not really making sense with that question. Tell us about your interactions with the Talc, Buterin and how lame he was. Yeah. I mean, he's just not a very good coder and people act like he's some brilliant wonderkind, like any other College graduate, has lots of ideas on how to make things awesome, and then they try coding it and they fall on their face, except with Vitalik. He doesn't fall on his face because he's printing his own money to cover whatever mistakes he's made. So I feel kind of bad for him because I think he could have been a decent software engineer had he gone down that path. Instead, nontechnical people seem to, like worship him as a deity because they're not technical enough to know that what he says is mostly kind of stupid. But yeah, he's not a very good software engineer and you can tell by the way Ethereum is designed. Can you explain tap rude in a dumb down way? And what's next? Yeah, I already answered that. Why aren't Stablecoins issued on or on top of the Bitcoin network yet? I mean, it kind of was. Heather was for a long time on the Omni protocol, which was on top of Bitcoin. Then they moved to Ethereum, now they're on Tron, and I think on Liquid as well. You can do it, but generally Bitcoin is on a going to be courting you to put your stuff on their network because they're using it for Bitcoin. What's the difference between engineers like Satoshi, Jack Mullers, and you, and between thinkers like Vitalik, Buter. Well, I would say that there's probably more respect for stuff that's been hardened, at least for Satoshi. This is clear when you look at the protocol. Satoshi used some part, like their signatures, for example, distinguished encoder rules or something like that. He used something that was kind of heavy handed and had like seven extra bites. But he did it because it was hardened. A lot of people knew it and there were already libraries to check it and so on. And that's what he used. Whereas Vitalik thinks that if it wasn't invented here, then it's no good and he needs to make his own. And of course, he makes insane stupid mistakes like having no checksum and addresses another BTC mining ban in China right now. I mean, that's kind of already happened. And a lot of that hashing power is moving out of China as we speak. Probably a lot of it is coming to North America. Yeah, we'll be seeing what's going to happen with that. All right, so those were the questions on Twitter. Let's see if I had any on what's wrong with vegetables. That's funny. Well, the thing that's wrong with vegetables is that they really don't provide that much nutrition. Most of it is fiber, and our bodies don't know how to process fiber. If your body wants to process fiber, then you're going to essentially be like a cow which has four stomachs and choose 18 hours a day. We're not cows and we don't have four Sonics and we don't chew 18 hours a day. Most of that just goes right through us. So it doesn't have that much nutrition, period. Alright, let's see if there's any on LinkedIn. Yeah, nothing on LinkedIn. Nothing on YouTube. All right, so there we go. All right, so let's pull up some people. Please raise your hand if you want to ask a question and I will bring you up and you can ask a question except flow there you go. Yeah. What's up overflow the way these things work is that you need enough senators and congressmen to sort of push for it possibly a President and honestly this administration is probably not really that into Bitcoin and I don't see them expending their political capital to do that. So you have to kind of make it worth their while and this is sort of like the dirtiness of politics is that you get what you pay for. So in order to make it worthwhile you have to throw some money around. You have to donate to a lot of campaigns and say, hey, you know what? This is my one issue. You get this done and I'll keep the money flowing. At some point we might want to do that but I don't know many of us in this community being libertarian. I don't think that way is necessarily something we see as that honorable. I think eventually we get that anyway. But yeah, it requires a lot of money being thrown around, a lot of lobbying and so on. All right. Anyone else with a question? If we don't have any more questions then I think we are done with this episode. Thanks. Thanks for listening and hopefully you got something out of all the questions that are answered anyway. Fiat Delinda the song is done. ",

Gladstone's piece is going to be amazing. So stay tuned for that one. Tap root is here. I'm so stoked about that. I think we're probably going to do another. I'm going to be on the thing with Swan to answer questions about tap root this coming Thursday, I think at like 07:00. I think it's going to be a Twitter spaces, if I'm not sure if I'm not mistaken, but I'll tweet out and share and everything. So just follow me. The Guy Swan on Twitter if you want to participate in that. But I'm probably going to do another. Episode on Taproot just for a refresh because it really has been quite a while now since I've talked about it. And I know there's lots of new people and I'm sure you got lots of questions. So if you do, shoot me a DM, just shoot me a random message, just tweet at me and I'll try to make sure that I answer any questions about tattoo when we get back to that. So, yes, right now, because I'm not done with Gladstone's piece yet and lots of other stuff. Preston Pitch I was just on the. Show with. Greg False and Preston Pitch on the Investors podcast and we had a hell of a show. Now, you guys probably, many of you probably already listened to it. I know a lot of you follow Preston, but just in case, I just wanted to post it here so you didn't miss it. We had a ton of fun. Greg Foss really tears it up and talks about the situation in the bond markets. We really kind of hit the whole kind of the state of financial world, really. And also a little bit about. The culture and just kind of how big, how massive the shifts that we're going through right now really are. And it was a super fun episode. So I hope you guys enjoy this.

Like we said in the introduction, I'm here with Greg Foss and Guy Swan. Gents. Man, this is going to be a fun one. In fact, as we were just warming up, you guys made the suggestion that we should all have a bourbon or some type of drink in hand. And so I have to tell you, this is the first interview I have ever done on this show where I was having a drink. And I think that this is the perfect interview for this occasion. Cheers. Now, I did do a live discussion where I forget what it was one time. We had a drink on that, but it wasn't my show doesn't count. We're the first toxic apartment. That's exactly what it was. This is my first question for you guys. This pop culture thing, no one's talking about this. I think this is a really big deal. You just saw Aaron Rogers today come out and he's giving away $1 million worth of Bitcoin on cash app. Tom Brady. I was watching the World Series. I see all the umpires wearing FTX jerseys. It's literally written on the mound, FTX. You got all these professional athletes. It's kind of crazy, right? What are you guys thinking? The impact of just that is so.

I think Bitcoin has a very important place in this and Ethereum has an important place in having a more conservative sort of monetary asset. Let's say that sort of has these monetary properties that you describe and having one where we sort of push the technology of cryptocurrency and crypto economics and this new cryptography with Snarks, we have this currency where we can sort of experiment with that in this other direction, which also necessarily means that, yeah, the nature of the money itself is going to revolve too. If that makes people uncomfortable, that's fine. And you don't have to like it or you don't have to use it, you don't have to own any. I would more lean into that to try to make the silly argument of like Ethereums, it's more the Austrian money or something. It seems all of it silly on it. So you had kind of mentioned the idea that Ethereum has changed their monetary. Policy in the past. And one of the rebuttals to that I've seen is so as a Bitcoin, they fix their buffer overflow bug. Do you think that's a fair rebuttal or is that total bullshit? No, I don't think that's equivalent. No. So basically I don't. I don't think that's equivalent. I think sort of taking this aside from the Bitcoin versus theorem debate, I guess I do think that there is a bit of nuance in there that often doesn't get addressed. So, yes, fixing something like the buffer overflow or fixing the more recent CVE, I guess it was last year that could have led to inflation. What's sort of going on there on the Bitcoin side is in a very indisputable way. The particular software instantiation doesn't reflect what is effectively this social contract that Bitcoin is have about what it is. Right. There's no one who actually thinks that you should be able to double spend within the block and inflate the supply that's indisputable. We can just say that. So updating the software, which is technically a hard fork. There's a sense that that is different than updating the software to say, well, after the Dow hack, let's say, to actually change the state or to change the inflation. I don't think those are the same at all. The tricky part and I'm curious sort of what your thoughts are on this, to me, is that one thing that I think about often sort of struggle with the fact that that was possible. The fact that there was this potential inflation bug in Bitcoin and dispatch was released and it worked. The bug wasn't exploited. The fact that that's possible is actually really important. You could even go a step farther. And say if it wasn't possible to do something like that, and you know, you can just focus on those two examples we mentioned, Bitcoin would be dead by now. Right. And to me, when I think about Bitcoin, when I think about its security model, I just think we need to include that in it. And one of the things that I see with a lot of people, some people, I should say, certainly not all of them, but some people in the Bitcoin space, there's a resistance to even mention that. And there's this sense of the social level is totally separate from the protocol. And the whole point of Bitcoin is to eliminate that social level. And there's no Bitcoin community. And I think that's half true. Right. It is indeed true that the point of Bitcoin is to minimize that level without that. I think like Nixebo articulated this pretty well in that social scalability essay. This is sort of what it all comes down to is not have to do this kind of bureaucratic decision making process as much. But I kind of think in a way that essay, a lot of people mention that and it was very influential. It was almost like too influential for its own good because the social scalability you get from Bitcoin is not infinite, nor do you want it to be. We need to actually be able to do these changes on a social level. So I don't know, even mentioning the phrase Bitcoin community makes a lot of people just like Bristol and Cringe. But to me that is an important thing. There are decisions to be made and it's not just about fixing these concrete bugs. There's going to be Schneider signature, there's going to be Taproot, there's changes the protocol will make when they have to do something for quantum resistance at some point. And let's just acknowledge the fact that there are human beings that have to make these decisions. And to me that has to just be a part of how we think and talk about this. But yeah. Anyway, I don't know, I'm curious what your thoughts are on all that. Typically I'm not the one answering questions on the podcast here, so please. Yeah, you forgive me here, but it's kind of a tough one. ",

This is sort of what it all comes down to is not have to do this kind of bureaucratic decision making process as much. But I kind of think in a way that essay, a lot of people mention that and it was very influential. It was almost like too influential for its own good because the social scalability you get from Bitcoin is not infinite, nor do you want it to be. We need to actually be able to do these changes on a social level. So I don't know, even mentioning the phrase Bitcoin community makes a lot of people just like Bristol and Cringe. But to me that is an important thing. There are decisions to be made and it's not just about fixing these concrete bugs. There's going to be Schneider signature, there's going to be Taproot, there's changes the protocol will make when they have to do something for quantum resistance at some point. And let's just acknowledge the fact that there are human beings that have to make these decisions. And to me that has to just be a part of how we think and talk about this. But yeah. Anyway, I don't know, I'm curious what your thoughts are on all that. Typically I'm not the one answering questions on the podcast here, so please. Yeah, you forgive me here, but it's kind of a tough one. ",

      "text": "Last thing I want to talk about is terror. I think it's a really interesting way to kind of apply a thought process as to where this could be going. So for those that don't know, you have bitcoin layer one, we then get layer two on top of that, trying to make it more scalable, cheaper, faster, which is Lightning Network. And now there's this idea from Lightning Labs they put forward called Tarot. And the idea is that you would be able to create all sorts of different assets on top of and tie into eventually the layer one of bitcoin. Via a decentralized ledger. Correct? Yeah. And so when you think about that, if the world does move to a fully digital world, which seems to be the overarching trend over the last couple of decades and centuries, even, is it one ledger, or do we end up getting multiple ledgers? And really it gets at this point of like the bitcoinners that are upset or don't like the idea of Tarot. Is it because they don't believe that other assets will become digital and need a decentralized ledger? Why are they not as excited about it, maybe, as the people who are working on it? Well, a lot of people believe that we don't need a bunch of tokens, we need one. And I would agree in a sense. Right. So we need one money. We don't need a bunch of money. So you talk about business. Obviously, the best business show, and part of a business is to reduce friction. You want to reduce friction as much as possible. I might have 15 minutes to kill, and there's David Busters and I might want to play a couple of video games, but I don't want to go stand in line and have to convert my dollars into the stupid tokens. So there's friction. I won't even play. Right, so we want to reduce friction. I could see they're having one money, but there are other assets. We're going to continue to have businesses, people are still going to want to invest into businesses, like we're still going to have other assets. I don't see that going away. So the ability to own those assets, whatever they may be, shares of a real estate, property, shares of a company, I could see those other assets needing a way to own them and hold them and have custody of them. And so I think having tokens is a way to do that it's so. Fascinating because I've used the example in the past of why do people invest to get more dollars, right? If you're in the United States. And so your whole idea is, I'm going to take dollars, I'm going to put it in some other asset that is going to outpace the growth or decline of the dollars, and then when I sell, I will get more dollars. In the Bitcoin world, there's a lot of folks who think of it as, I'm going to take my dollars, I'm going to convert it to Bitcoin as decentralized digital currency and I'm going to hold that. But it's hard for me not to see a world where there's people who say, okay, I have Bitcoin and I have three Bitcoin, I'm going to invest. So that something out paces and then I get five Bitcoins. And if Bitcoin becomes your reserve currency, then naturally you're going to want more and more of it. And that would be a metric for gaining wealth. I think the critique of that viewpoint is what's going to outpace Bitcoin is 125% compounding growth rate of last decade. It's like, how do you think about that? Is it that the compound growth rate will go down over time and eventually you'll have to investigate more? What do you think? Yeah, of course. Of course it does. It can't keep going up like that forever. I go back to history. So how did it work on a gold standard? People saved gold, they consumed less than they earned and they lent it out. Right? And the rich people would lend to the kings and the governments go back and watch Game of Thrones, right? So the rich people are loaning money out. So people earn less than they consume and then they loan it back out. And so people always do that. Obviously at some point we're going to have to see that the rate of increase is going to go down. But I just go back to that. History shows us how it works. And people are always going to want to lend for more yield and to increase what they have. And we're going to need economic growth. People are still going to have ideas to create new products and new things and they're going to need startup capital to do that. And people are still going to be willing to lend money for that. Yes.

      "text": "Now, when you speak about going to equity, how does that connect to the existing regulations around equity fundraising? I know there are some crowdfunding platforms that do raise inequity, and there are certain limitations they have. Do you think Bitcoin crowdfunding gets around some of these issues? Do you think Bitcoin has to play by the rules that have been set in the kind of pre Internet or pre Bitcoin era? Or do you think those rules change to adapt to Bitcoin in a situation where money can just flow really easily and all of a sudden it doesn't make sense to restrict only accredited investors or only X number of dollars per fundraise? What are your thoughts on the regulatory side of this? Well, I'll start off by saying that's really not my expertise. So whatever I say is kind of my hand wavy opinion on the topic. I think the main limitation is that when you're talking about equity, you're talking about securities, and securities have a legal framework that you still want as a project creator. You still want some of these protections. You don't necessarily want all of the protections where you only give access to that credit and investors and such and such, but you still want a legal framework around your company. And I think that is not something that Bitcoin necessarily directly souls because I don't know if I'm in Europe and I'm investing in a company in the US. How much can they do to protect themselves and how much can I protect myself? This, I think is still problems that are pending to be solved. The thing that I do think Bitcoin may solve and assets on top of Lightning may solve is the fact that we don't want to use paper shares anymore. We don't want to trust some broker or whatever that is holding those papers that you've never seen and for which, until Robin Hood, there were no fractions of this is not what the digital age is going to be about. So this is definitely something that I believe will happen. Natively digital shares that can be subdivided up to very tiny fractions. And at that point, if you solve the accounting system that is linked to fractions of a share, then why limit who can invest in that? Why limit the minimum that you can invest? This should be probably the decision of the business owner. How many people do they want to have as investors? If you put this limit very low, then you open the door to having 100,000 people that can invest in your business and maybe that's too much for you to handle. So in that case, let's see what the free market decides. But I think the business owners should have a say and not necessarily too much. Investor protection is the thing that's really. Interesting that you brought up being able to natively represent equity on something like Lightning. Is this something that you think Tarot enables tarot like Lightning Labs recent Announcements Is that something that do you see a world you got my head spinning with ideas here. Do you see a world where equities of all kind can be represented on Lightning in the same way that I think in Tara's blog post they mentioned that all the different kind of Fiat currencies can be represented on Lightning, right? You can represent all sorts of stable coins. Can you also do equities? My technical understanding of terror is still pretty limited, but I will say in theory, if you can represent assets, you can probably represent equity as well. It is equity as a form of asset, with the difference that it falls within a jurisdiction. And something that's interesting about the Lightning network is that you break apart from the consensus limitations that the base layer has, in the sense that on the base layer the set of rules that you follow is the set of rules that everyone follows and that the majority sort of has to follow. On a network like Lightning, the rules that people follow are loosely defined. And if as a node you decide to follow different rules, then you sort of detach from the network or the part of the network that doesn't agree with those rules. You can still communicate on the rules that you do agree with, but on the rules that you don't agree with you're kind of part of a different subnetwork. And so there could be a world where equities operate within a sub network of nodes that have a lot more legal restrictions than the nodes that simply transfer anonymous assets or transfer Bitcoin in itself. That's really interesting. A lot to think about. That Tarot announcement the other day was. Quite lots of expectations and then someone has to build it. Yeah, 100%. It's a long way before I think any of that gets implemented, but very exciting to see that being brought into the mainstream. Discussion on Lightning okay, one more final question for you. What is your favorite Lightning application to use today? Is there anything interesting that you've been playing around with that you want everyone to know about and that maybe people haven't quite recognized yet? That's a tough one. I use a few. Well, this is a boring one, but I've discovered Zeus and started using Zeus a bit recently. The mobile wallet was the mobile wallet. Right. Which we think about mobile wallets as the obvious step and kind of the boring aspect of the infrastructure, but it's really critical. And if we don't have enough mobile wallets, if we don't have enough options, then your entry into this world is also limited. So we want as many wallets and as many good wallets as possible out there to really have the best set of choices and the best wallet in the end that emerges from those. Now for the slightly funny one, and I'm not sure if that qualifies as a Bitcoin or Lightning application, but just yesterday I discovered a little guy called Sam on Twitter. He's a nine year old Bitcoin game developer and he built a few games that don't have Lightning integrated into them yet, but he's working towards it and he's definitely a Bitcoiner. And so I was playing his game yesterday trying to break a record and how quickly you can finish the game, and I think that sums it up for me. There are so many bright minds and the future is so bright with Bitcoin, there are so many smart people that are working towards a common goal that it really does feel pretty unstoppable. And so some was just a little glimpse of that future, and I'm sure he's going to be building a lot of interesting games around that. That's very cool to see. And I agree, in the last six months or so, I've been really impressed with the pace of innovation and Lightning. It seems like it's picking up steam and there's a lot of really smart people building in the space. Not to say that everything is perfect. I think there's a long way to go in getting more people to be Bitcoin developers and to get people more on board with the ecosystem, but it's a good sign. I think we're headed in a good direction and excited to see where this all ends up. Absolutely. Thank you so much for taking the time to chat today. This was awesome. I'm really excited about what we're building with geyser as well. For people who haven't heard of geyser, where can they go to learn more about geyser and about you?

So these are all things that we're exploring, right? We don't know exactly how things will play out. There's a lot of different ways to approach this, to approach all of this stuff. While I won't give away our specific plans, we are very interested in this direction. We're very interested in seeing the lightning network grow, flourish and prosper, and using our position as a depository institution to facilitate the liquidity for payments like this. So the short answer is yes. The long answer is that's more of a direction, but there's still a lot of figuring out the Devil's in the details with this stuff. Right? Right. For example, how do you know what price we're going to convert at? Is everyone agreeing on that price? How do you guys make sure we're not like, scamming you? There's like a lot of protocol details left to figure out there. And so I don't want to sort of hand wave away some of the complexity with this stuff because I think as it gets built out, we'll start to learn a lot more about sort of some of the worst and some of the things that will take time so modest and take an engineering approach to this and really making sure we deeply understand sort of the ins and outs of it before committing to a product. Do you see any regulatory challenges with people issuing assets on Bitcoin that are then tradable on lightning? There's always going to be regulatory challenges with this stuff. I think the regulatory challenges are going to be similar to wrapping assets on Ethereum or Salona. Right. One way to look at it is kind of like just look at USDC, look at rap Bitcoin. What are some of the compliance things that they face? How does that apply to a Tarot world? I think the answer is still a little sort of murky. So I think a lot of people don't understand regulators. Like if you mention Taro and DC, they have no idea. They don't even know. Right? Yeah. They don't even know. So no one else knows either. So everyone's going to basically take the best effort. Anything that gets built is going to like there's no law on the books about how to deal with a Tarot asset. Right. So everyone's going to take sort of like what they think is a reasonable approach that sort of in the spirit of the regulations and isn't facilitating criminal behavior that the US government doesn't want to facilitate. Right. Yeah. I guess where I was heading with that one was kind of thinking about what if the assets being issued on Taro are not just dollars? What if they're stocks? Then all of a sudden we have, I guess, clear frameworks for how to issue stock in North America, but I guess it's a different mechanism for issuing stocks now. Now it's a lot easier to do than going through some regulated entity. Well, yes and no. So, I mean, the same thing applies to ERC, 20 tokens on Ethereum. The burden will be on the issuer. Right. And at the end of the day, an equity is a government construct to begin with, like rights to a company which is created by a government. Government haven't invented the concept of a company and then being able to give people rights to a fraction of that company and legally enforcing those rights, it's all a government construct. Right. So it's actually not like a technical or on chain challenge. It's actually more like a real world question. Yeah. Of what's going to fly and what's not and what government is going to do in response. Yeah. Okay. I want to go back to a discussion about your routing node on the Lightning network today. So right now, I believe you have the fourth largest node on the network. I've been tracking the numbers of the public capacity numbers for a little while, and in the last 50 days, you've added about 50 Bitcoin to your note of public capacity. What signals are you seeing right now that tell you it's a good idea to add all this Bitcoin, to continue adding over time? Because right now I think your total public capacity is about 150 Bitcoin. So you've added about 33% of that in the last 50 days or so. So what thing those are trends. Are you noticing that compel you to continue adding to your node? I think it is important to sort of understand what this number actually means. So this number is basically the capacity of the channels that river has opened. Right. What's not actually always visible the network is what side of the channels is that capacity on? Right. So this doesn't mean that we have 150 Bitcoin on our side of all of these channels. And if our node got hacked, 150 Bitcoin would be stolen. Right? Right. It's the sum of the total capacity of every channel we have. Basically a lot of this. Some of it is river demand, river clients depositing and withdrawing every time someone deposits to us, that signals to our peers to open more channels with us. And we're also sort of routing for some big players that are moving funds on and off of other big exchanges bigger than river. You have like BitFenix Kraken and all these guys. And so they have big channels with us because we're very well connected. They're routing a lot of things through us and basically just by positioning, just having a high quality node that's very well connected. And also, there's an aspect I think that a lot of people don't really realize is that reputation as a firm is actually going to be important in the Lightning network. Right. Especially if you're connecting to other big players. So we're a desirable peer for other big institutions because on the off chance that there is something happens with the channel. Right. Like, let's say there's some technical glitch and we do a justice sort of transaction to sweep the funds. They know we'll make them whole. Right? Right. There's more real world sort of dynamics than you might initially think. So that's sort of like a long winded answer. But there's a lot of reasons that we have a lot of big channels and that's a few of them. I guess one of my assumptions there was that the channels that you have are going to be roughly balanced, that your public capacity is going to be roughly two times what the funds that you have on your side versus with all your peers. Is that a realistic assumption to make for exchanges that is it ideal to have your channels perfectly balanced? Is there a mix that you prefer? That's not 50 50? I think the way we run things, I don't know what the current state today is, that we basically keep an eye on the channels we care about. And when they do get low or Imbalanced on one side or another, we'll take actions to rectify that. If we know, for example, that Bitfinex is a very popular destination. Right. And that channel with BitFenix starts getting low, we have an alert that will open a new one, stuff like that. I hope you're enjoying the show so far. I just want to give a quick shout out to our sponsor, Voltage. Voltage is the industry standard for lightning network infrastructure. Creating layer two applications and services on top of Bitcoin starts with Voltage, where you can spin up nodes, get access to liquidity, optimize your node, and much more. Voltage is leading the way as the next generation provider of lightning network infrastructure. And if you want to get a free trial and start using Voltage today, you can do so at Voltage Cloud. ",

      "text": "got it. I want to finish things off with a couple of Lightning predictions. First one I want to ask is what do you think public capacity is going to be in the year 2025? Oh, man, you're killing me. My case study brain is working, trying to work backwards, but I'll just put a number out there that's three years from now, let's say 30,000 Bitcoin, I think a ten X within three years is a total possibility, and I might be being a little bit conservative. Maybe it's in that 30 to 50,000 range. I think that the use cases that we see pop up with all these different apps and products that are building on Lightning are going to drive the utility of the network so high that capital is going to have to be allocated more and more as we sort of reach that more and more utility of the network. Yeah, I've asked that question to a few different guests, and you're by far the most bullish. So I like that prediction. And the fact that you said it's conservative, too, that's a little bit conservative. If you look at the growth over the past four years or so. I think a ten X is something that's totally within the realm of possibility. Yeah. Okay. So how many nodes are on the network in 2025? Good question. So there are different measurements for nodes. I think right now, depending on what you're looking at, we have anywhere from 20,000 to I think like 60 to 80,000. But I'm going to use active nodes with the channel open. So we're around, I think like 25,000 or something in that range. Let's go for a nice even 100,000 nodes on the network. If we three X number of capital, maybe we go up even more in terms of the number of nodes on the network. Ten X capital there. Oh, yeah, sorry. Ten X number of capital. So maybe I think like a nice even $100,000 because I imagine that you'll have more nodes that have more capital than potentially this stage of growth where we've had a lot of hobbyists and different folks like that. You see it with someone like Kraken coming on board to the network where they dumped a lot of Bitcoin into their node right off the bat. So I think as we have larger businesses seeking yields and return on their Bitcoin in a noncustodial manner, maybe you see the growth of capital grow at a higher rate than the number of nodes on the network. Right. How many exchanges have not integrated lightning by the year 2025? Have not integrated lightning? Yeah. I think it's not contrarian to say that exchanges are going to be integrating lighting anymore. Like now. We've seen a few in recent weeks and months have either integrated or signaled that they're going to integrate it. How long does it take to get all the main let's say I don't know, the main top ten or top 20 exchanges in the world. How long does it take to get them all onto lightning? This is a good question. I don't want to get our director of BD Ryan in too much trouble here, but I will say that by the year 2025, the vast majority of exchanges will have lightning. I think that once you see these exchanges that are adding lightning and sort of the benefits that it provides from a potential arbitrage perspective for traders. Right. And being able to move money between exchanges instantly and therefore like top off margin positions or arbitrage price differences and different things like that, as you have more exchange coming on board, I think it's going to be an advantage for them. And you'll have other exchanges who kind of FOMO in because they don't want to be the last person to integrate lightning because that would put them at a disadvantage with regard to the benefits. Of it right now. Final question. What is the dollar value of assets listed on Tarot in the year 2025? The dollar value? I would suggest what's the Bitcoin value? But that also introduces them the question of what's the Bitcoin price in 2025. So I guess we got to stick with the dollar value and maybe in 2022 purchasing power in case we get a bit of extra inflation in the next few years. Oh, man. So let's see. I set a ten X in terms of capital on the Lightning network. So that would put us in the range of, I guess, a few billion dollars, depending on price and different things like that. We'll assume Bitcoin price goes up. So I think it's more than that. My hope is that I think it will be in the range of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of Taro assets on Lightning. I think Lightning network will obviously be more than that theoretically. But yeah, my hope is that we get into a range where it's hundreds of millions or billions of dollars that are Taro assets. And again, that enables sort of these routing node operators to see way more activity and earn these routing fees on the movement of the capital without again having to do anything. So it's exciting to think about the possibilities there. So what is that split then between Tarot assets of if you say, let's say around 1 billion, if you're saying hundreds of millions to a few billion, let's use 1 billion today. If we had 30,000 Bitcoin at today's prices, we'd have almost a billion. But you suggested Bitcoin price may go higher. What does that split look like in 2025? Are we going to have always more Bitcoin on the Lightning network then we will have Taro assets on the Tarot protocol? Or is there a potential for like, how do those two relate to each other? I think that because Bitcoin is at the core of the network in terms of routing, you're always going to need a certain number of Bitcoin to fulfill the needs with regard to routing assets on the edges of the network. Kind of like you will always need a certain number of Bitcoin to fulfill the needs of the apps and services on the edges of the network with regard to their routing activity. So my hypothesis would be that we do see more Bitcoin on the network than potentially target assets. But I'm not 100% sure about this. I think that I'm fascinated by the ecosystem that develops around Taro and what exactly happens there. And so it's possible that there are way more Taro assets and it's using the Bitcoin liquidity, and it's kind of reusing that capital in such a way that there doesn't need to be more Bitcoin than there are Taro assets. Got it. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time today. I enjoyed going into all these different topics. I learned a lot. I'm sure listeners did, too. Where can listeners go if they want to learn more about you, the work you're doing, and if they want to contribute, if they want to help out and build the Lightning ecosystem, where can. They go, yeah, absolutely. So if you want to learn more about me, you can find me at Michael Levine on Twitter. And then in terms of the Lightning network, you can go to Lightning Engineering and then if you want to connect your node to Terminal and sort of play around with the different functionality there, I would encourage you to go to Terminal, Lightning Engineering and connect your node. In terms of contributing, we have the Ln repo and GitHub. It's something where we try to put up issues for beginners. And so if you see anything that you want to do there, definitely take a look. And then we also have started a biweekly L and DPR review club, which basically goes through PRS, and we review the comments and the different components there to try to help people understand how they could make a contribution to LNG and how they could help with reviews and different things like that. That's bi weekly on Thursday, and you can find out more details through our Twitter account at Lightning. Awesome. Excited to follow along with the progress and hope we can do this again soon. All right, sounds good. Thank you so much, Kevin. Appreciate the time. Welcome ",

And so it's possible that there are way more Taro assets and it's using the Bitcoin liquidity, and it's kind of reusing that capital in such a way that there doesn't need to be more Bitcoin than there are Taro assets. Got it. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time today. I enjoyed going into all these different topics. I learned a lot. I'm sure listeners did, too. Where can listeners go if they want to learn more about you, the work you're doing, and if they want to contribute, if they want to help out and build the Lightning ecosystem, where can. They go, yeah, absolutely. So if you want to learn more about me, you can find me at Michael Levine on Twitter. And then in terms of the Lightning network, you can go to Lightning Engineering and then if you want to connect your node to Terminal and sort of play around with the different functionality there, I would encourage you to go to Terminal, Lightning Engineering and connect your node. In terms of contributing, we have the Ln repo and GitHub. It's something where we try to put up issues for beginners. And so if you see anything that you want to do there, definitely take a look. And then we also have started a biweekly L and DPR review club, which basically goes through PRS, and we review the comments and the different components there to try to help people understand how they could make a contribution to LNG and how they could help with reviews and different things like that. That's bi weekly on Thursday, and you can find out more details through our Twitter account at Lightning. Awesome. Excited to follow along with the progress and hope we can do this again soon. All right, sounds good. Thank you so much, Kevin. Appreciate the time. Welcome ",

Now, that's not to say that there are not things that we want at the base layer. There are features or additional capacity, or not capacity, functionality, functionality that we would want at the base layer. Probably the thing that is close to home for me that I feel like is necessary at some point, or at least highly desirable, and that we would want at the base layer is some sort of fundamental privacy guarantee. And there is no guarantee. Privacy is always a spectrum and you go back and forth between the anonymity set and the cost savings and all this stuff. Like every all privacy has a trade off and there's nothing perfect. So don't get me wrong, I don't think we could put monaro ring signatures on Bitcoin and then it would all just work and we'd all be private. I think that would still come with. Quite a bit of trade offs. But I think there is something, honestly, I kind of think there's still something in Taproot. I think there's going to be a very high privacy benefit out of Tap route that is not realized yet. There's going to be something that we can do with it that essentially, I suspect, I suspect that with Tap root in combination with coin joins and then just signature aggregation in general, and the need to consolidate space on the base chain as much as possible. And then as we get into peer to peer markets where people are actually using bitcoin for transacting rather than going back and forth from the dollar, which is really the number one, that is it that's the KYC mote. Everybody is having to attach their identity and all of their information to an address with the threat recently with so many BlockFi and swan bitcoin and all these other companies that just got hit with the hack. I'm not sure if you all heard about this, but HubSpot and the hack wasn't so bad. It's not like these companies themselves got hacked. It was a company called HubSpot, which everybody was using for some sort of data, and apparently email addresses got leaked. I can't remember specifically. I'll get like, basically funds are safe. I think even what amount of funds there are. I think IP addresses got leaked, I think IP addresses got leaked. I can't remember for sure. I'll get the thread and I'll put it in the thing. So if you want to check it out, you can see it in the show notes. But it's a mess. It's a mess. Trusted third parties are security holes. This was a huge honey pot for metadata from all of the users, because so many different services were using this service in order to do this part of the process. And I can't even remember what it is, honestly, I literally think it was like 30 different major companies in the bitcoin space for using this and this one central server, just this honey pot of information. It's stupid ass KYC and all the relevant information like that's. It the movement between dollars and bitcoin are where all of the problems are. It's where all of the regulations are, it's where all of the KYC is, and it's where all the honey pots end up. And that's why I think as we move into a purely peer to peer, where we are actually using lightning, where bitcoin is actually the medium of exchange and the unit of account. That's why I think this is more of a transitional problem, because as we transition to that, all of the blockchain analytics blockchain analytics works because one person is going from a KYC exchange to another person, and then they're sending it to their KYC exchange. So when there's that tiny, tiny gap between the KYC addresses, then it's super easy to connect things. And then it's also super easy to look at the activity of a single set of UTXOs on chain and basically connect them together, that they clearly look like they're involved with each other, or that they in regular patterns, so to speak, to basically tease out with the activity on chain. But when that goes from a KYC exchange to somebody's wallet, and then they spend something to that other person's wallet, and they spend here and there, and they're just spending they're actually using it as their money to like four or five different places, or they're just opening channels and then using lightning payments, and then that other person is sending lightning payments. And it goes from one person to two. To three. To 45678. 910. 1112. And then in another country. On another KYC exchange. Going to a completely different currency. That's where the bitcoin actually ends up hitting KYC again. That's going to be a much more difficult proposition to attempt to trace it through all of that and also particularly if you're going to and from lightning or to or from liquid. Who knows what all the involvement is when this is actually fundamental infrastructure that everyone is using or at least a significant portion of the population. Whether or not we're talking about full hyper bitcoin Ization or five or six years from now where I hope we have an insanely robust PeerToPeer or circular bitcoin ecosystem. Nonetheless, privacy ",

Has read more about Bitcoin than anybody else you know, and we have got. Tons to dig into. So as everybody knows, Bitcoin 2022 was nuts. There were tons of announcements to dig. Into and I am trying to figure out Taro. That has been my focus the last two days while I finish up a bunch of other stuff and work on the room. But Taro is issuing assets on top of Bitcoin hidden within the tap root. Script so that there's absolutely no blockchain. Bloat in doing this. It's in fact, from the perspective of the blockchain, it might as well not exist. It's just behind a signature, just like anything else would be. And then also the ability to actually. Send these over the Lightning network. And it's a really interesting set of tricks and I'm trying my best to. Wrap my head around it. I've read the announcement. I have watched a'roast beef's presentation from. The open source stage at Bitcoin 2022 two times, three times maybe. I don't know. I've gone back and relisted. You know how he is when he talks. It's so hard to actually discern what. He is saying because he talks so damn fast. So I've been trying to make sense out of that and I'm digging through the spec on GitHub right now as. Well, but there's no way I'm going. To be able to fully wrap my head around it today. So I figured the best way to start this off, this is absolutely going to be two episodes. I'll have a guy take tomorrow, probably depending on how other things go and get finished, but I will have a guys take, trying my best to explain. The inner workings of this, how this thing works. I hope to understand it by then. But today we are going to go through the announcement and I want to talk about what it means and kind of an overview of how I understand it so far. So the announcement is this is written by Ryan Gentry. This is all from Lightning Lab. So it's on Lightning engineering their blog. And simply put, this is a really big deal. This is a really big deal. And I think this is going to. Be really incredible to see how this unfolds. Because I did not see the scope of what tap root was going to make available in this way. Because it's essentially taking what we are able to do with our data and. Creating our own metadata for any other. Tokens or side chain tokens that we want to actually send on bitcoin or US dollar. Stablecoins and stablecoins really are the focus here, but it's basically able to do. That without any operata or with operata in a sense, something akin to that, except hidden within a tap root script so that it's just not on chain. I mean, it is on chain. You prove it by checking data on. Chain and it's still secured from double spending with on chain expenditures with unchained scripts, but the data footprint is basically nonexistent, which is just the whole thing is crazy. And like I said, I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. So let's not waste any more time. In setting this up. Let's get into the announcement and then I'll have a short guys take on. As best as I can, give an. Overview of this and then we'll really dig into this, hopefully tomorrow. Alright with that, real quick, thank you to our wonderful sponsors.

      "text": "And the reason I think these seven elements of bitcoin, that this vision of bitcoin is so strong and why I think it actually won't be corrupted is that it's in a sense a set of rules because it is codified, because the protocol embodies those rules. It's as if we have a story and a mission that's being codified or written in a way in which the meaning cannot change. Something like a constitution can always be interpreted differently. And you can have so many seemingly clear comments that one person under a separate bias will interpret exactly how it works best for them. And even the same words can come to mean something just a few years later. It has nothing to do with its original context. You can always manipulate the way things are. And this is why law is such a finicky thing. Something that always grows towards greater control, towards more centralization, is because no matter what you do, you cannot stop the interpretation of it from evolving to feed or to back up the desires of the people interpreting it. There's no way for it to always mean exactly what it was intended to mean. But Bitcoin has fundamentally changed that. The consensus rules don't care about our interpretation of them. They are hard coded, they are explicit. There is an absolute mathematical certainty about when that consensus has been violated and when it has not. And because of that. The elements around it. It's story. It's ethos. Are mere extensions of something that is real. Something that is actually codified and unalterable. Which is why there's actually a chance that this thing could survive for an exceptionally long amount of time. That this could be a set of rules. A system of equal power. And something built for the people that actually use it to make society a better place and to give us a totem where we can all communicate and own value. That has no political center. That has no one benefit greater than anyone else. That is even anti fragile in the face of an adversary or of some change. It can actually evolve within its own consensus rules to defend itself from changes in the world. It is the DNA of a better society. And that vision of the future that it's not all just hopeless, it's not all just going to get worse. We actually have a solution to some of the fundamental, the absolute largest problems of today's society sitting right in front of us that we can play around with, that we can build on top of, that is available right now, today. And so many people are missing that. That's why you have evangelists, that's why you have people that do nothing but talk about it all day in and day out and tell all their friends and family about it because there's hope that we can actually fix some of the shit. But anyway, I thought this was a really great piece, such a fun concept to talk about. I love the idea of the kind of anthropological nature of vision, the system of belief around Bitcoin, because it really is interesting and it's core to so many things that are human. Humanity is so deeply based upon the beliefs and the understandings and the visions we have for the future that we hold together. And it's just a fascinating topic. So huge. Thank you to Paolo for putting this together. Great piece. He's actually got a copy. It was on Medium. I found it on Medium before they posted it on Bitcoin magazine. So I'll post both links. But if you want to go give it some applause on his Medium page, definitely do. Don't forget to thank our wonderful sponsors and check out their amazing products. The bitbox. Two hardware wallet.

      "text": "to Bitcoin as a successful humanitarian payment rail is either local liquidity so that the recipients can easily cash out into fiat when necessary, or circular economies. The former has expanded dramatically across the world in the past few years, and the latter is already being built today. If you want to support a humanitarian project in any country in the world from Iraq to Senegal, all it takes is for the recipient to have a smartphone. From there, they can receive Bitcoin directly on a free open source Android app like Moon or Blue Wallet, and then, when necessary, shave it off over time into Fiat through PeerToPeer markets like Paxful, local Bitcoins or informal telegram channels. Aid, donations and remittances can now be sent to individuals. In El Salvador, for example, with the help of Strike, the Lightning network powered platform developed by Jack Mallards, Rockstar, Dev and others became three weeks after launching the number one finance app, number one top up app, and number one overall app in the country. This growth was powered by the Bitcoin beach circular economy and community, which is now having spillover effects and sparking other nascent communities, not just in El Salvador, but even in neighboring countries like Guatemala. The idea of Strike as a humanitarian tool is very compelling. Any American, for instance, could pay any Lightning invoice with their debit card with the funds delivered in Bitcoin instantly with final settlement anywhere in the world directly to a recipient's phone. Leveraging Lightning, which has tiny fees, settles instantly and has barely any energy footprint, seems like an especially promising way forward, especially in a world where payment processors act as rentseeking middlemen skimming 2% to 5% of online gifts. Ultimately, one of the biggest obstacles to effective international development has been the fact that there are so many third parties between the donor and the intended recipient. Often there are Kleptocratic governments or exploitative monopolistic corporations. With Bitcoin, there is a new model to cut straight through this mess and connect granters and grantees in a PeerToPeer way to the extractive society. In their book Why Nations Fail, economists Duran Asimoglu and james Robinson break the world down into two kinds of societies inclusive and extractive. Inclusive societies, such as South Korea or the United States, quote, are those that allow and encourage participation by the great mass of people in economic activities, that make best use of their talents and skill, and that enable individuals to make the choices they wish. This contrasts with extractive societies, which depend on absolutest political institutions for their survival. Inclusive political institutions vesting power broadly would tend to uproot economic institutions that expropriate the resources of many, erect entry barriers, and suppress the functioning of markets so that only a few benefit. But in extractive societies, those in power are able to counteract these forces and, quote, enrich themselves and augment their power at the expense of society. In general terms, aid flows from inclusive societies to extractive ones. Asimogu and Robinson told the tragic story of the Congo, which has for centuries suffered under highly extractive institutions. From the kingdom of Congo to the genocidal reign of King Leopold, from later stage Belgian colonialism to the dictatorship of Mobutu and today's rare mineral wars, elites and foreign powers have plundered the country's vast natural resources, skimmed incredible profits, destroyed the environment, and decimated the population. Mabutu, for example, owned a palace with an airport big enough to land a Concorde jet, which he rented to fly back and forth to Paris, and bought castles across Europe and even owned large tracks of Brussels. Meanwhile, Congolese citizens under his reign suffered from hyperinflation, abject poverty, rampant violence, and a nearcomplete lack of consistent electricity. Modern, DRC. Robinson and Osimo Glue wrote, remains poor because its citizens still lack the economic institutions that create the basic incentives that make a society prosperous. Political power continues to be narrowly concentrated in the hands of an elite who have little incentive to help the people. Aid does not fundamentally change this and sometimes helps prop up the oppressors who keep their people down in the first place. What if a new type of humanitarian aid could break this model of dependency instead of aiding and abetting it? Part Three a Bootstrap for Independence all right, let's take a quick break right here for our sponsor, and we will jump back in on part three. Speaking of untrustworthy governments and corrupt rent seeking middlemen, when you hold your own keys, you aren't dependent on either. That is why a secure, open source Bitcoin hardware wallet like the Bitbox Two is the standard for a sovereign holder. And the Bitbox is great because the device is really just easy to set up and start using. The desktop app is very minimal, yet has all the features you want for the privacy and security of your Bitcoin. It's got Tor network support you can connect to your own node very easily, coin control for extra privacy and separation of funds, that 32 address format, et cetera. It's also got one of the fastest backup and restore solutions out there, with a micro SD card. It's a great device for both new bitcoin and and long term holders. And with Discount Code Guy you get 5% off, which is not too shabby either. And take a moment and send Shift Crypto a shout out for supporting bitcoin audible. Without them this show would not be possible as it is now. A huge thank you to them and all of the amazing supporting listeners out there for keeping the lights on and the microphone powered. Check out the bitbox two at shift Crypto dot ch part Three A Bootstrap for Independence Billions of people in developing nations face the stranded power problem. In order for their economies to grow, they have to expand their electrical infrastructure, a capital intensive and complex undertaking. But when they, with the help of foreign aid or investment, build power plants to try and capture renewable energy in remote places, that power often has nowhere to go. In many countries across Africa, for example, there are vast solar, wind and hydro resources. These forces could drive economic activity, but local communities and governments usually lack the resources to invest in the infrastructure to kickstart the process. Foreign donors and investors are not keen to support projects that do not have a pathway to sustainability or profits. Without strong transmission lines to deliver energy from harvest points to population centers, power plant builders could wait years before they can run without foreign subsidy. Here ",

I think Lightning is really interesting, but it hasn't scaled anywhere near as quickly as stablecoin derivative, for instance. That's not an indictment of Lightning and its potential. It's just a factual state of affairs and where the industry is right now and where the tech is it's also factual to just say that it is orders of magnitude easier to build on Aetherium and actually even on new emerging stacks like Salona than it is to build on the bitcoin stack if you're a developer thinking about a new application. So these are just raw numbers, right? So you can get people to debate about the security model underpinning the blockchains themselves or about what's coming next when it comes to extensibility the bitcoin platform, we need to build on a really robust foundation. I think those are arguments to be had, but in terms of where we are today, in terms of capital, in terms of human capital and brain power, most of the interest is still on. Emerging layer one protocols that are a little bit more complete in terms of the functionality and the application they support like Ethereum and some of the other so called L one s. It's just not happening at the same speed or scale on bitcoin yet. Maybe that changes, but I think that the sheer number of people and kind of the caliber of talent that are building outside of lightning versus within the bitcoin community is pretty stark and it's not in the favor of the bitcoin.

It's just a factual state of affairs and where the industry is right now and where the tech is it's also factual to just say that it is orders of magnitude easier to build on Aetherium and actually even on new emerging stacks like Salona than it is to build on the bitcoin stack if you're a developer thinking about a new application. So these are just raw numbers, right? So you can get people to debate about the security model underpinning the blockchains themselves or about what's coming next when it comes to extensibility the bitcoin platform, we need to build on a really robust foundation. I think those are arguments to be had, but in terms of where we are today, in terms of capital, in terms of human capital and brain power, most of the interest is still on. Emerging layer one protocols that are a little bit more complete in terms of the functionality and the application they support like Ethereum and some of the other so called L one s. It's just not happening at the same speed or scale on bitcoin yet. Maybe that changes, but I think that the sheer number of people and kind of the caliber of talent that are building outside of lightning versus within the bitcoin community is pretty stark and it's not in the favor of the bitcoin. Dallas right now if you just look. At the raw numbers ",

In that one, it didn't receive tons and tons of hype because it didn't raise venture capital. There is no kind of native token to it. So there wasn't a token sale or anything like that. It feels like it's continuing to grow organically under the radar. How important is that as kind of a key way to make sure that the right people are building on it and the right people are adopting it. They're going to be here for the long term. Well, here's what you can do when you don't have a token right. You can actually respond and get clear signals from users, so you can respond to true user feedback. When there's a token, of course, the activity that you see from users, it's very noisy. So a lot of users, when they're participating in a token driven ecosystem, are there to speculate on the token. And because Lightning doesn't have that, when it launches in a new market or is integrated in a new app, we can really see from that user base the value that they get from the protocol, from the technology. And with that, then we can rapidly innovate. And that's what you're seeing. So that's exactly what happened with Tarot. We saw this really beautiful adoption to infrastructure development feedback loop. So you introduce the new infrastructure, in this case Lightning network, to a user group. They adopt it. You can watch their behavior and engagement metrics. From that, you can discern feedback, and then that drives the next cycle of development and innovation and infrastructure side. So that Tara, is really a beautiful example of that. Now, in terms of who should be building on Lightning, 2021 was amazing to see this because there was really a sort of shift in terms of the diversity of who was building. So while in earlier cycles we had bitcoiners building, and a lot of these folks are just so brilliant, they're really almost like bitcoin native thinkers somehow. In 2021, though, the dev tools and the environment was more mature. And so we were able to see people that were not religiously bitcoin or were not building because it was bitcoin, but we're building something within their space of expertise that could be benefited or advanced by bitcoin and by Lightning.

      "text": "the old multi SIG is old. The current multi SIG in Bitcoin is a script, right. That you have individual keys and they sign. A program like the script out and that's going to dictate what these keys are going to do. Yes, but script as in yes, obviously in that structure, but script is in. We actually write it to the bitcoin blockchain. Like, you can go to the bitcoin blockchain and see the script and it says, I need two of three keys. And then you wait for a transaction that has two of the signatures, but all of it is publicly available because you have to broadcast it to the blockchain for the blockchain to be able to enforce that. Well, the ECDSA multi party is a way to make a single address, a single key. That's the only thing that you put on the blockchain is just the one key, but that is broken up as a multi SIG from the user side. So you're actually generating a single key and it actually looks like a legacy address, which is actually kind of cool because you have additional security and the fact that you have a huge anonymity set because there's millions of legacy addresses on the system. Like they've been using that since the Genesis block. Legacy address as in starts with a. Public starts with a one. Okay. The SegWit and the P two Sh stuff starts with a three. And then you got the Beck 32 addresses that start with a BC, I think. Okay, so there's multiple address formats. Well, the one that is still the predominant one is legacy addresses that start with a one. There's now a lot that start with a three because SegWit is 60% adopted for current clients now. Good, that's picking up. But now we can put multi SIG behind both of them and not even use the script on Bitcoin that I can have my single legacy address that starts with a one actually have a two of three multi SIG behind it just in generating the key in the first place, which is pretty powerful. That's an awesome thing. This is your friendly reminder to Rate subscribers. They say the best things. They come in threes. Like great subscriber view, if you're ready. Five stars. We can raise the bar subscribe so you can stay in too. Don't forget at the very beginning to leave a nice review. Something like I love you, sue. Rate subscribe review, please. Thank you. So essentially it's creating redundancy without taking up space on the chain. It's creating multi SIG without taking up space and broadcasting that it's multi SIG on the chain. Yes. You're not having to tell Bitcoin that it's multi SIG, but you have multi SIG. Okay, yeah. All right. That goes back to great for privacy. Exactly. Really good for privacy. There's a lot of technologies and there's a lot of things on the move like that. And Taproot is another great example of being able to do that, which does require a software, but it's a really powerful tool in exactly that same way. And it's a whole lot more capable than just the ECDA multiparty because you can write entire scripts. You can do tiers of you could hide an unbelievable amount of complexity behind a single key with Tap root. That's kind of the beauty of that. Advantage of the merkel tree structure. Right, exactly. And you can write a full three chain or three branch lightning contract, like with multiple execution outcomes. And it's all just one key. It's all just like one address. A child of a child of a child. Exactly. So broadcasting a lightning channel on chain versus broadcasting a normal transaction, they look identical. And that's powerful. That is really powerful, as it should be. It's pseudonymous, it's public. But having alphanumeric characters where you don't know what the hell is behind it is really the goal. But. I guess what makes it audible, like, we want, like, auditable blockchain, is that just to make sure that a block is be mined? Or is that essentially why auditability is essential? Auditability is something we want for the money supply and the consensus rules. That's pretty much it. We don't really care about anything else. The problem is, or the trade off, is that there are certain degrees of privacy that risk the auditability of the system. So if we lose auditability, we basically lose all of the guarantees that are put on top of that. Privacy is a secondary guarantee. Payments are a secondary guarantee. You have to have a sound digital asset first. And that is what auditing the entire system entails. And there's just only so much that you can compress data without losing that auditability. But that's the whole idea of, like, lightning, of tap root, of all of these things, is that you're finding ways of adding functionality, you're finding ways of using it in a far more dynamic and malleable way without compromising the auditability at all. Even though you might have five or six multiple parties doing a bunch of things behind the scenes, at the end of the day, when it's broadcast to the Bitcoin chain, you still just have input output. Does the difference add up? Like, were any coins created? No. Good to go. It doesn't matter. We don't need to see the rest of that stuff. You all do whatever the hell you want off chain, as long as the settlement as long as it's signed back to a settlement transaction that can be fully audited and follows the Bitcoin consensus rules. Yeah. So the auditability is really just to make sure that the economics and monetary policy is still in check, we can. All see that we still have sound money. And outside of securing sound money, outside of securing the consensus rules and the monetary policy, we don't want anything on chain. We want as much of it as possible to be invisible because then that's when we're worried about payments, privacy applications, all of the other things that we can get with a financial system built on top of this. But yeah, cool. Do we cover everything you want to talk about from the Hasu article? Let me think. So probably just ",

They are inherent to the nature of bitcoin. But I think noncustodial lightning, I think it is going to be comparable to the most custodial options out there. I think it's going to be as easy to use as something like strike wallet, satoshi, like these other things. I absolutely think I'm going to be able to just be like, you should get a Breeze wallet, you should get a Zap wallet, or whatever it is. And the onboarding through, like things like loop in, loop out, being hidden behind like a moon wallet, M-U-U-N completely hides the fact that you are doing either a bitcoin or lightning transaction. And there are other things about the wallet that are not as user friendly. But if you combine the best of Breeze, the best of Moon, and the best of Zap, then you have a non custodial wallet. I would also add Phoenix actually with turbo channels so that you immediately are able to use it straight out the gate. But if you combine that, they're already there, they're all there. They're just independent in different wallets. If you combine them all into a single wallet, you have a non custodial lightning wallet that the second you send money to it, you are able to spend through a lightning channel. Whether or not you are paying a bitcoin invoice or a lightning invoice, you are looping in or looping out accordingly, it will choose which one to make, which transaction to make, and you have low fees. And if your channel balance doesn't work, you will loop in. You will potentially splice in in the future or do a multi pass payment or whatever the hell it is. I think this can all be obscured away and I think we have really kind of seen like 90% of the pieces already developed that are needed to make that happen. So I think noncustodial Lightning will be as user friendly without a doubt as many of the best custodial options. And with the increasing use and focus on those things, I think we will also Lightning has a huge potential to start a peer to peer market for aggregating transactions. Yeah, you talk about this a lot. What exactly do you mean by that? Well, if you get to the sense. Of like samurai for privacy, is that the only pro in this case? When you say aggregating, what is coming to your mind of all the positives of that? Splitting fees, lowering that exit cost for as many people as possible at once. Like hasu talks in his article about how the banks do it, the banks will do it and that will outcompete the regular user that they can batch a whole megabytes worth of transactions and therefore they can also pay a higher fee and price everybody else out of block space. But people individually involuntarily come together to make their own third party in a sense, but it's not their party. It's completely peer to peer if anything. Exactly. Imagine being able to split that if we have things like Snore signatures, if we have things like taproot, if we can put multi SIG behind a single key and if we can save that cost at the exact same rate that the bank can and we have a peer to peer market for signing and aggregating these transactions together. Like sort of like think about a combination of the tools needed in Pizza pool where people mine in a decentralized way and there's no actual pool behind it. And then think about like the incredible orchestration that happens between something like a coin join and Wasabi wallet where everybody is adding their transaction data and all of this is being aggregated but nobody is trusting anyone. Combine those things with the fact that you can pay over Lightning the 10th of a bitcoin transaction fee into some sort of HTLC pool of aggregating transactions together and then broadcast the closing of a thousand channels all at once from a whole bunch of people who are just participating in this together. Who all split the fee over Lightning and then they have filled an entire block with a single transaction that is done in a completely decentralized and trustless way for all of its participants and gets everybody 100 of the clock. Exactly. It's crazy efficient. So everybody is paying a tiny fraction of the fee that they would have paid to close their channel individually. Now, does this obsolete things like Whirlpool and coin joining do you think? Or because I asked that because you have to pay a fee to do that, but you're paying a fee to swap your coins for anonymity and privacy and avoiding taint. Now do you think this aggregation will have that embedded into it and actually obsolete those kind of services? I think it's absolutely possible. And I think it also makes sense too, because if you're already getting a pretty powerful level of obfuscation, if you can figure out a way to batch transactions like that in a trustless manner because there's no longer the one input to two output transactions that you see all over the place. Like those are one of the absolute that's like the absolute foundation of chain analysis. There's so many just standard one to one transactions on bitcoin and you can chase those strings of transactions to find out who owns what and get them back to an exchange and then compare them against exchange data and bank information and spying notes and all this stuff. But this makes actually swapping the default and no one notices because it's just. Abstracted away essentially is that so much is added together into a single pool of information that you're already getting a larger anonymity set. But then also you can add in some of those things like the coin join mechanisms and stuff. Like you can put a degree of mixing and okay, let me use two rounds of dispatching to open and close this channel or to move these funds and obfuscate exactly where they came from and who they went to because you can trustlessly swap in this situation.

And with the increasing use and focus on those things, I think we will also Lightning has a huge potential to start a peer to peer market for aggregating transactions. Yeah, you talk about this a lot. What exactly do you mean by that? Well, if you get to the sense. Of like samurai for privacy, is that the only pro in this case? When you say aggregating, what is coming to your mind of all the positives of that? Splitting fees, lowering that exit cost for as many people as possible at once. Like hasu talks in his article about how the banks do it, the banks will do it and that will outcompete the regular user that they can batch a whole megabytes worth of transactions and therefore they can also pay a higher fee and price everybody else out of block space. But people individually involuntarily come together to make their own third party in a sense, but it's not their party. It's completely peer to peer if anything. Exactly. Imagine being able to split that if we have things like Snore signatures, if we have things like taproot, if we can put multi SIG behind a single key and if we can save that cost at the exact same rate that the bank can and we have a peer to peer market for signing and aggregating these transactions together. Like sort of like think about a combination of the tools needed in Pizza pool where people mine in a decentralized way and there's no actual pool behind it. And then think about like the incredible orchestration that happens between something like a coin join and Wasabi wallet where everybody is adding their transaction data and all of this is being aggregated but nobody is trusting anyone. Combine those things with the fact that you can pay over Lightning the 10th of a bitcoin transaction fee into some sort of HTLC pool of aggregating transactions together and then broadcast the closing of a thousand channels all at once from a whole bunch of people who are just participating in this together. Who all split the fee over Lightning and then they have filled an entire block with a single transaction that is done in a completely decentralized and trustless way for all of its participants and gets everybody 100 of the clock. Exactly. It's crazy efficient. So everybody is paying a tiny fraction of the fee that they would have paid to close their channel individually. Now, does this obsolete things like Whirlpool and coin joining do you think? Or because I asked that because you have to pay a fee to do that, but you're paying a fee to swap your coins for anonymity and privacy and avoiding taint. Now do you think this aggregation will have that embedded into it and actually obsolete those kind of services? I think it's absolutely possible. And I think it also makes sense too, because if you're already getting a pretty powerful level of obfuscation, if you can figure out a way to batch transactions like that in a trustless manner because there's no longer the one input to two output transactions that you see all over the place. Like those are one of the absolute that's like the absolute foundation of chain analysis. There's so many just standard one to one transactions on bitcoin and you can chase those strings of transactions to find out who owns what and get them back to an exchange and then compare them against exchange data and bank information and spying notes and all this stuff. But this makes actually swapping the default and no one notices because it's just. Abstracted away essentially is that so much is added together into a single pool of information that you're already getting a larger anonymity set. But then also you can add in some of those things like the coin join mechanisms and stuff. Like you can put a degree of mixing and okay, let me use two rounds of dispatching to open and close this channel or to move these funds and obfuscate exactly where they came from and who they went to because you can trustlessly swap in this situation.

      "text": "don't quite work the same way. Yes. So they work in every how are they different? Yeah, so they have a very similar functionality to HTLCs, but they're better in a couple of different ways. So I'll start with just what's one problem with HTLCs or hash time lock contracts. So it's actually exactly what you just mentioned. You have to use the same hash everywhere. That's like the biggest downside of HTLC. Reason being it's terrible for privacy. Like it causes what we call payment correlation. Even if there wasn't a way to literally tag payments with a hash that was common between places, you would still say, I mean, there's still things to worry about. Just like there is on tour. Right. You have to worry about timing and size of packets and all these kinds of things. And there are mitigations for all of those. But anyway, right now in Lightning, it's just like we have this big problem. Before you think about any of those things, you have to think about the fact that anytime you're routing something through the network, it has a hash associated with it that's unique. That like if two people along the route are actually the same person and they see that hash twice, they know that this payment came from this area of the network and went to this area of the network. So it's bad in that sense. It's also bad because it enables these things called wormhole attacks, wherein if this exact scenario happens where two nodes are communicating with each other, maybe because they're the same person, two routing nodes along the route see that they have the same hash rather than doing the normal thing when the payment completes of just passing the pre image back on. This way they. Can directly they can kind of skip over everyone in between them and give it from one person over here in the route to this person all the way over here in the route. And by doing this, they steal all of the routing fees of everyone in between them and keep their funds locked up. They can just grieve them as if it was a failed payment and it's indistinguishable from a failed payment to all of the nodes in between. There's no data, doesn't even it acts just as if the payment fails. Even though the payment succeeded, they just didn't get their cut. So for the receiver and the sender, everything went through fine, but they gipped everybody in the middle because they managed to privately, in a completely different way translate. They sent a telegram message those guys in the middle, and we'll get or. If it was one server running both nodes, even better. It's just like yeah, exactly. So that's a problem with HTLCs, is that you have these wormhole attacks and they're very properly incentivized. Like you're going to want to do these acts. They run your competition out of business. Right? So anyway, this is part of the motivation. So this is kind of the negative side of the motivation. The positive side is you can do a bunch of stuff with PTLC, but you can't do with Hdlcs at least as easily. But the first thing is like HTLCs have this problem. How do we solve it intuitively? What we want to do is we want to use a different hash everywhere. Right? So how do you do that? Well, the thing I've been mentioning about, zero knowledge proof, you could like prove that this is the Tweak version of this hash or something like that, each time you go along and do some kind of weird cryptography there. But no one wants to do that. So luckily there's a better way. So what you can do is instead of using hashing like Sha 256 for example, you could instead, as your hash function, use elliptic curve points. So essentially before your eyes glaze over listeners. Literally all I mean is like, you know how you have a private key and then you generate a public key from that and your public key gives no information about your private key. It has the same property as a hash in that it's a one way function. You can't reverse the process. But as we all know, you can do a bunch of other stuff with keys you can sign, you can do all sorts of other stuff, but they still have this one way feature about them. So if you use kind of public key function, however you want to think about it, points is what they actually are. Which is why we call this point time off contracts. If you use points as your hash function and then do the same thing, now we have kind of more things we can do. So now you can add two points together and that now corresponds to the points associated with the addition of the two secrets of those two points. So taking this back to public key, private keyworld, which I think people are more comfortable with in the future under Taproot, for example, if you have a two of two multi SIG that's just going to be one key and how you get that key is you combine the two public keys together. It doesn't require anything more than that. It doesn't require some kind of use of the private keys in some fancy way to generate this aggregate key. Essentially, the idea is you can use these aggregate points to tweak along the route and to do it in a way that can be verified without zero knowledge, proofs that are hard and fancy. Essentially what you do is you're like here was the point before, here's the point after and here's the secret. I used to go from here to here. Like the secret, I added the tweak that I added to it. And then so each person knows only their own tweak. And so each hop along the route has a different point, a different hash. If you want to be sloppy about language, which a lot of people in the literature are, and some people still call these HTLCs, which I personally find confusing, but I get it. Whatever. Because at the end of the day, the point is a hash. It's just a lot more than that too. A hash in the sense that it's a one way fingerprint of the previous secret. So for an analogy of this so it's kind of like whereas in the ",

      "text": "hash time lock contract in the current setup is that you're using the same fingerprint for each hop. And therefore if you're a hop four and hop two, there's no reason for you to go back to hop three. You can just scoot right around and give it to number two and pretend that that person doesn't even exist. Whereas in the point time lock contract is that each hop is a new fingerprint and it's being added to the previous one. Kind of like getting a secret. Yeah. So kind of like how like onion routing is I have an envelope that has a destination on it and then I open it or I send it to them, then they open it. There's another envelope with another destination. They open it again. The onion layers exactly the next step. And this is that for the lightning payment for the key to unlock it. So everybody can only see the next step fingerprint and therefore four can't skip it to two without getting the fingerprint for number three along the way. And on top of all of that, we get to keep the nice property that locally all you have to care about previously was that the hashes were the same so that you don't end up with the bill. Now it's that the points are tweaked by a secret, you know, right? So that you can untweak it. That's the only thing you care about. And then it has this macro property, like you mentioned, that now you can't skip anyone, you need everyone. And not only that, so that mitigates the wormhole attacks, but also you just have better privacy, right? You can't tell if you're these two nodes along the route, they can't even know that this is the same payment. I mean, they can guess maybe depending on amounts and timing and all the other things that you have to worry about when it comes to onion routed networks. But at the end of the day, like if there are two distant notes and they see these two different payments, especially in a world where we're using amps, so all payments and our nations are relatively small and things like this, they won't even know that those two payments are related. So we call this payment decoration is the property that we get from these PTLC because they're different points and different times and different places. Previously, the reason that they knew that they were along the same route is because the hash was the same and then they used that to exploit this other problem. But now not only can't they exploit it even if they knew, but they don't know, which is another great benefit there. So not only can they not skip three because they don't know three, they have no idea that four and two are related because they don't know three. Yes, exactly. That's how it is. This is kind of the way in to PTLC. So hopefully what I mean by that is if this was all we got from point time law contracts, I think it would be enough. Definitely we should do it this way, but it just so happens we get so much more from using point time lock contract. So, first of all, another property here, that's nice. One quick question before we get into all the other cool ass stuff we. Can do with it. Does this need tap root or anything? So it needs adapter signatures, but we can do those with ECB believed that we needed Snor for we now know we can do it with ECDSA. But it is still worth noting that the ECDSA version is inferior to the Schnore version. It's 162 bytes adapter signatures versus 64, 60 or 64. Okay, yeah. That'S a big difference. A little slower. But the biggest thing is that it's bigger. And the reason why is because it has a little ZKP in there, which is 97 bytes, and then the rest is just a normal signature. But luckily the ZKP is like the simplest possible one. Even I read through it the first time and understood it. Which not that means that readers are normal people necessarily can do that. But I personally, I'm like in the middle there where I'm like I can understand some things and not others. And this is like the easiest possible ZKP that you could hope for. And this is what's required in order to do Ecbsa adapter signatures. And luckily it's actually already in production use. This particular DKP is called a Deluxe Proof. Discrete logic. Quality proof. But in bitcoin we're weird, we don't use the academic term, which is Deluxe proof. We call them Poodles quality clouders, we call them Poodles. And they've been in production and join market since join market has been out there and they're used for something else there. But yeah, we essentially literally just took Poodles and then that's kind of the only new thing you need in order to do adapter signatures on ECDSA. But for a myriad of reasons. The primary one being that this is so new. Like we only knew this very recently that you could do it using ECDSA. There aren't any real plans to have PTLCs on Lightning before tap route because everything's going to be redone for tap root anyway. We don't want the intermediate step necessarily. That said, there are proof of concepts being built on today's Lightning using ECDSA adapter signatures, but it's not going to be widely deployed, I don't believe. It doesn't make a whole lot easier for learning to invest in it when you'll have the simpler and lower cost solution. I mean, I personally I'm on the fence on that point, but I understand that people who are working on Lightning and that's what they're working on, this is kind of out of the way and they might as well wait for taproof. I personally think it would still be worth it if we implemented Ppl stuff today. But I'm very biased seeing that's the stuff I want to see exist as possible. No patience here, but yeah, no, I understand totally why this isn't going to happen unless I'm working on DLCs. I can't do it, so I can't expect other people to do it. They're working on stuff too. Anyway, point is point is we'll get PTLCs when capital channels are around. This is a non contentious change for the Lightning Network, I believe everyone is on board with PTLCs, just generally, and the only thing that hasn't been done is rewriting a Lightning network node, which I shouldn't say the only thing that's quite a big thing, I think. Previously I posted to the Lightning dev mailing list being like, here's the current status of what we know about PTLCs, how we could do them today, et cetera, et cetera. And I was like, the only thing that would have to change is this and change the state machine. And then I got a response from Roast Beast being like, I wouldn't say the only change. This was constantly the biggest change the Lightning Network has ever undergone. You're right, Darn. Anyway, some work to be done, but it's totally possible and it's popular and we'll probably get it with tap root and yeah, it can do a lot more than payment decoration, though. That's awesome. Be happy to get into and I guess the first thing, though, which is still related to stuff we've already talked about is I mentioned that you get this receipt over the Lightning network, which is useful for things like if you want to monetize an oracle and sell some data over Lightning. So this receipt today, it's just a pre empty to the hash we've been talking about. So it's not really a payment receipt, it's a part of a payment receipt. Like to do things today on Lightning, which people are doing, you need like and you need to know a public key from the user or something like this, because everyone along the route gets this pre emerge, right? Like they could pretend they paid for it and claim whatever it is. Or if you were thinking about, say, you're selling tickets to an event over the Lightning network and the ticket is literally this payment pre image, the preemption to this hash, well, you can't do that because now every time you sell a ticket, it's a route of ten people. You just sold the same ticket to ten people, ten people on accident. Whereas now, since every single hop is different and only the payer learns the actual pre image without all the nonsense added on, without all these tweaks, it's an actual proof of payment. It proves that if you know the secret, you're the person who originated the payment and was actually footed with the bill, you didn't pass it onto someone else using a tweak. So interesting. So in the current sense, you need the public key of the person you sent it to and public key, I. Should say, not necessarily like their Lightning ID. Yeah, you just need something from them that only they know the secret to. Exactly. Got you. But ",

But luckily the ZKP is like the simplest possible one. Even I read through it the first time and understood it. Which not that means that readers are normal people necessarily can do that. But I personally, I'm like in the middle there where I'm like I can understand some things and not others. And this is like the easiest possible ZKP that you could hope for. And this is what's required in order to do Ecbsa adapter signatures. And luckily it's actually already in production use. This particular DKP is called a Deluxe Proof. Discrete logic. Quality proof. But in bitcoin we're weird, we don't use the academic term, which is Deluxe proof. We call them Poodles quality clouders, we call them Poodles. And they've been in production and join market since join market has been out there and they're used for something else there. But yeah, we essentially literally just took Poodles and then that's kind of the only new thing you need in order to do adapter signatures on ECDSA. But for a myriad of reasons. The primary one being that this is so new. Like we only knew this very recently that you could do it using ECDSA. There aren't any real plans to have PTLCs on Lightning before tap route because everything's going to be redone for tap root anyway. We don't want the intermediate step necessarily. That said, there are proof of concepts being built on today's Lightning using ECDSA adapter signatures, but it's not going to be widely deployed, I don't believe. It doesn't make a whole lot easier for learning to invest in it when you'll have the simpler and lower cost solution. I mean, I personally I'm on the fence on that point, but I understand that people who are working on Lightning and that's what they're working on, this is kind of out of the way and they might as well wait for taproof. I personally think it would still be worth it if we implemented Ppl stuff today. But I'm very biased seeing that's the stuff I want to see exist as possible. No patience here, but yeah, no, I understand totally why this isn't going to happen unless I'm working on DLCs. I can't do it, so I can't expect other people to do it. They're working on stuff too. Anyway, point is point is we'll get PTLCs when capital channels are around. This is a non contentious change for the Lightning Network, I believe everyone is on board with PTLCs, just generally, and the only thing that hasn't been done is rewriting a Lightning network node, which I shouldn't say the only thing that's quite a big thing, I think. Previously I posted to the Lightning dev mailing list being like, here's the current status of what we know about PTLCs, how we could do them today, et cetera, et cetera. And I was like, the only thing that would have to change is this and change the state machine. And then I got a response from Roast Beast being like, I wouldn't say the only change. This was constantly the biggest change the Lightning Network has ever undergone. You're right, Darn. Anyway, some work to be done, but it's totally possible and it's popular and we'll probably get it with tap root and yeah, it can do a lot more than payment decoration, though. That's awesome. Be happy to get into and I guess the first thing, though, which is still related to stuff we've already talked about is I mentioned that you get this receipt over the Lightning network, which is useful for things like if you want to monetize an oracle and sell some data over Lightning. So this receipt today, it's just a pre empty to the hash we've been talking about. So it's not really a payment receipt, it's a part of a payment receipt. Like to do things today on Lightning, which people are doing, you need like and you need to know a public key from the user or something like this, because everyone along the route gets this pre emerge, right? Like they could pretend they paid for it and claim whatever it is. Or if you were thinking about, say, you're selling tickets to an event over the Lightning network and the ticket is literally this payment pre image, the preemption to this hash, well, you can't do that because now every time you sell a ticket, it's a route of ten people. You just sold the same ticket to ten people, ten people on accident. Whereas now, since every single hop is different and only the payer learns the actual pre image without all the nonsense added on, without all these tweaks, it's an actual proof of payment. It proves that if you know the secret, you're the person who originated the payment and was actually footed with the bill, you didn't pass it onto someone else using a tweak. So interesting. So in the current sense, you need the public key of the person you sent it to and public key, I. Should say, not necessarily like their Lightning ID. Yeah, you just need something from them that only they know the secret to. Exactly. Got you. But ",

      "text": "All right, Michael, did you have some questions? I was going to look at the audience questions. Yeah, well, we do have some good audience questions. I think. Go down some of the list of ones we have. There's one from Billy. BTC. How often can we expect additions to be made to the lightning network Bolt specifications and how likely is it for both current or future to change after being accepted? Do you guys want to explain what bolts are? Both 1.0 and then 1.1 now? Sure. The bolts of education is like a collaborative effort by primarily blockstream Async and lighting labs. And there's other people, too. Mac Prowl is pretty heavily involved. There's a group called Tarmage that's starting to work on as well. And so really, it's like a collaborative place for us to write down in detail how these protocols should interact with each other. And that gives you sort of a basis to go off in terms of what can I expect from my peers, how should I be sending messages, formatting them, all those things. And really, that just minimally defines the actual interface between two nodes. It tells you nothing about how to actually basically build these on the back end. There's a lot of gaps you got to fill in that, but it just sort of defines this minimal intersection of how do we need to communicate with each other in order to accomplish this task of, say, opening a channel or sending a payment. And so, in my experience, in the last year and a half, both get updated fairly frequently either. Just because we realize there are edge cases that we should account for and document specify, there's just like some slight improvements that we think we can make. I think down the road, some of them will sort of, like, solidify quite a bit. Some of them are pretty solidified, as is the transport mechanism. Bolt yeah. Or like bronte hasn't changed a while. Yeah, there are parts of it that are sort of ossified in a good way because we haven't had any need to change them. But yes, overall, I'd say. There'S definitely. More to come, I'd say, because there's a lot of new features and it would be nice to sort of like, start adding those as like, standalone documents, I guess. Yeah, I think as of right now, we basically been modifying this one rather than making new documents. I think because it's in getting it's pretty easy for us to kind of modify something and those things are typically done. There's changes that we're in kind of like the 10 after we kind of announced it, where things that we realize we're issues are implementations. Right. Once you actually start to interact implementations, either yourself kind of figure out what things like, okay, well, these can be a pain, or, well, okay, there's like a vector. Okay, well we should be using encrypted action or something like that. So many of those kind of like added on stuff after the fact. Now we have boat one coming out which is going to be kind of like the next version, which is in kind of like the super. I mean, one thing we said boat One is that it wasn't going to include any software. It was meant to be a more immediate thing. Right, so things around like dual funding, splicing, kind of cancer, things like that. But then both 2.0 or 1.2 ever decided we'll maybe have software like Tapwood or whatever else that may be kind of like really more radically redesign, kind of like more of a protocol. It's kind of like more like an incremental step, adds a bunch of really cool quality service things and things like that. I think we'll really make a difference when we start rolling stuff out in 2019. In Bitcoin there's a sort of feeling of over time we kind of do in a way want to ossify the protocol. Maybe there will be additional things, but we want something that's like here to stay for the next 1000 years or whatever. Do you think that there's going to. Be a similar trajectory or do you think it's going to always sort of continue to have that fast paced, like new features and all of that? I think it's a pretty good likelihood for the near future that it will continue to be like a very fast paced development cycle. Just because there are a number of things in the protocol where we know today we're like this can be better and either they're enabled by software in the future or we can do them sort of now. And so the protocol we have right now is working with today's Bitcoin. But I think as Bitcoin continues to evolve and opens up new doors and we'll continue to update the lighting protocol to take advantage of those features as well. Yes, and so I don't foresee it occupying anytime soon. Even like the basic mechanics of getting a free image for payment hash is likely to change in the future because you'll probably get like a secret key to a pubkey when we move to sort of like hockey correlation and Snore based Scribble script channels. So even the most basic fundamental piece of lighting itself today is probably going to be modified in the future. Yeah, because I think we can be a lot more nimage because we don't really require anything on we don't really require kind of global content update because it's kind of like okay, well I have to mention for one example something like amp. So right now Amp, we can use network today without modifying anything because it's a purely end to end protocol. Right. People really need what's going on. There's always kind of like having a bunch of little hooks in there that can do for things to come up to give things a lot more quickly. Even beyond that, I think because there's kind of like all of the network layer and kind of like writing things like that, many things are kind of even fully equal from Bitcoin itself. So we have a lot of research working on different routing protocols or different things like multi app blocks, referrals that can be realistic without any changes in Bitcoin. So I think it's just a thing where it's like, we can move more quickly because we don't require kind of a global flag day of upgrading, but there are some upgrades that will maybe kind of modify or restrict your actual set of possible paths. You're saying if we kind of like snore or something like that for Aclcs at that point, like, every single person in the path needs to have an update. But probably the thing where you have a flag where people have support both, then later on, they only support one of them. So I think the most kind of like a slow motion software and do something restricted. So that basically be that. Like, I have my note open, and I've decided to now support both types of signatures. But over X amount of time, I just noticed that the network traffic for the one type of signature has gone too close enough to zero, where it's like, it's not even worth it anymore for me to have it. And therefore I then just moved to shore only. Yeah, and there will be an incentive to also do that as well, because the Schmore based or like, ECSA script script variants will actually do smaller fees on chain. The witnesses you need are smaller, and so the witnesses and scripts are, like, quite a bit smaller. So there is, like, a financial incentive. People, like, upgrade as well. So that's kind of nice. The other thing as well, in the future, it would be more of a thing where you kind of blend it with the rest of the end result, like the actual chain everyone's using tapered and well, in the normal case, it's like, well, I signed up with the key. All that point ten open and closed don't really look like anything else, like anything different versus ten payment on change, which I think is pretty cool. Awesome. ",

      "text": "As the Bitcoin Network grows and Bitcoin continues on its trajectory to become the reserve currency of the world, people are going to look for more and more ways to take their Bitcoin and put it to work. Because we focus on Bitcoin, we can put the time and resources into taking things to the next level. That the Coinbases the Krakens of the world can't actually, if you look today at like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq or those companies actually don't make that much money. So I actually think Tara is very interesting because of the decentralized exchange. It's going to facilitate. There's an aspect I think that a lot of people don't really realize is that reputation as a firm is actually going to be important in the Lightning Network, there is always risk. There's risk if you're not earning any interest. There's risk just having Bitcoin in custody. Right? Like, there's always risk when I travel, when I talk to people, the people who really are the most excited are in developing countries. I think the lighting network is going to grow much more quickly in developing countries than in the developed world. Alex Leachman is the founder and CEO of river, a platform for buying Bitcoin that also happens to be one of the biggest players on the Lightning Network. In our conversation, Alex explained why he decided to launch river back in 2019 with a Lightning Network integration. We discussed some of the new use cases that Tarot could unlock on the Lightning Network, and we explored the risk reward tradeoffs for earning yield on lightning versus other forms of yield. Alex has also asked me to forward his share of today's show splits to the Human Rights Foundation. So if you learned something new from this conversation, if you enjoy it, the best way you can support the show is by sending in stats over the Lightning Network. 50% will go to me and 50% to the Human Rights Foundation. I've also made one change to the Lightning round at the end of every show. Instead of asking me questions, you guys can now ask future guests questions over the Lightning Network. So keep an eye out on my Twitter. I'm going to announce guests before they come onto the show. And in the day or so before the show films, I'm going to ask for you guys to send in questions. As a bonus, one of the questions that you guys choose to send in, I'll pick the best one and I will add it to the show splits of that episode so you'll have a chance to earn SATS as well. Just a quick shout out before we get into the episode. Today's show is sponsored by Voltage. Voltage is the industry standard and next generation provider for lightning network infrastructure. Today's show is also sponsored by Zebede. That's Zebede, and Zebede is your portal into the world of Bitcoin gaming. We'll have more from Voltage and Zebedee later in ",

Because we focus on Bitcoin, we can put the time and resources into taking things to the next level. That the Coinbases the Krakens of the world can't actually, if you look today at like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq or those companies actually don't make that much money. So I actually think Tara is very interesting because of the decentralized exchange. It's going to facilitate. There's an aspect I think that a lot of people don't really realize is that reputation as a firm is actually going to be important in the Lightning Network, there is always risk. There's risk if you're not earning any interest. There's risk just having Bitcoin in custody. Right?

So the peer to peer mining pools, the decentralized mining pools have always had some kind of big limitations and they don't scale very well. Now, I don't quite understand exactly how the proposal works. It's a little bit vague, or at least it seems like it is. Maybe it does have all the pieces of the puzzle that I need, but just kind of going through it. It does basically require a lot of hash power essentially to be a part of this, because you would actually have to be able to mine a block to be a part of this pool, but that you could somehow commit to remittances based on blocks in the past, which what could be interesting about that? Just in kind of my initial thinking of like, okay, how could you use this to better distribute or what's the term, to better decentralize the mining pool environment itself? Well, you can actually have what our large mining pools right now break up into smaller segments and essentially use this to combine the mining pools. So it's like a second layer mining pool. And that could be really interesting to let. Mining pools could still get to a size where they're large enough to mine blocks ever so often, but they don't need to get to the size of in order to really be economically viable, is that they can then coordinate with all the other mining pools that are 3% of the hash rate and you have this simpler potential or this easier mechanism to essentially decentralize that. Now, whether or not that actually happens, whether or not this protocol is actually that viable, or if there's a strict economic benefit to those smaller mining pools to join into larger mining pools but still keep that trust mechanism at bay to make it a less trusted relationship, the question is, do they get paid more? So I don't really know. There's a very kind of off hand thinking about how you could utilize that, even though it does seem you need a certain threshold of hash power to participate. That's a really interesting idea. It's one that I just hadn't thought about mining pools in a while and everything, all of my references are always like, okay, how can you benefit a lighting channel? How can you benefit a pool of people who are doing some sort of like miniature side chain or collective ownership of a trust fund with many members of a family. Et cetera. That's usually where my head goes initially when I'm reading or digging into some of this stuff. But we've already gone quite a bit. There's a couple of other interesting like being able to do like options trading. This is another use case for CTV here is that you could actually set up a little smart contract to pay out based on a certain pay in for literally like an options trade, like a tiny little futures contract that's essentially decentralized. So it's a little kind of mini DeFi sort of thing that you could do on Bitcoin that could actually be built into the script itself and not need a quote unquote service provider. I'd be very curious how you could do how you could expand something like that when you can actually put as part of the taproot tree, you can now put stable coins with Taro and have commitments because Taro is a tap root transaction within a tap root tree so that you can have all of the same things in tauro. You can all have all the same things in a stable coin that you can have in a bitcoin transaction. So you could then have commitments to stable coins. So you have really interesting dynamics starting to play out about actually being able to trade between some trusted fiat situation, some stable coin issued by some company but do so without the company needing to be a part of it, that you could actually have a completely contractual hidden within a tree of hashes and commitments options and some sort of trading contract between dollars and Bitcoin. And I don't know how you would exactly have you deal with the Oracle problem. Maybe this is still something that DLCs kind of solve because you just have the key of the Oracle and the Oracle doesn't have to be a part of it. But regardless, it does seem that there's something interesting there and I would bet good chunk of stats there's something that CTV can do that makes that a much much simpler application or slightly better guarantee as to the exit and require less trust in some centralized service provider or maybe a potential third party Oracle. But I don't have anything concrete. This is just kind of my spouting off and thinking out loud. Then he also puts on utxos.org some application to drive chains, which I did. In fact, if you want to hear the article about it, I read Paul Stewart's article. I think it's Paul's article. It might have been somebody else written about drive chains. Paul Storage is kind of the guy who has been pioneering and pushing for Bit 300 for drive chains on Bitcoin for a long time. It's funny that one of the proposed benefits is for drive chains and Shinobi is super push in CTV but hates drive chains. It's really funny. I had an argument with him. I wasn't arguing, I was just trying to find out why he hated them. So much on Twitter and it took a long time, but I finally grasped what his argument was and he called me stupid a couple of times before we finally got to it. Maybe I was being stupid, but I was not quite following what he was saying. But the issue with drive change to me, and this is a valid criticism that Shinobi has, I think. So I'm not really going to go into and I still don't quite understand how drive chains commit to like a hash to allow you to mine the side chain. And you have to have a certain proof of work. I don't really quite understand the mechanism and I haven't done enough digging into it. But regardless, drive chains, I feel like do the same thing for the scaling problem or not the scaling problem. Excuse me, they do the same thing for the security and node problem, the big block problem. The reason big blocks are a problem is because the cost of running a note is huge and you have to validate all the transactions to know that yours is valid. Right. Well, it moves the big block problem to a second layer. It moves it to a different spot, whereas kind of like in the context of congestion control transaction is ",

      "label": "Bitcoin Audible",
      "type": "podcast",
      "text": "a really, really important consideration, is to prevent a split in the Lot True community. That's something that Aaron talks about in this piece, and you can see a lot in the conversations and stuff, is that one of the issues here is that there will inevitably be a subset of the community, even if a Lot false client is released, that will still do Lot True. There is very likely going to be a subset of the community that picks Lot True and a subset that runs potentially their own client, if not false, gets chosen. And that could lead to a secondary argument, a splitting of the very users who actually do want to do Lot True, whether or not we would do lottru within the one year time period, or if we would do Lot True in the second time period following the first year lockout or first year timeout expiring. And I genuinely think that would lead to a bigger headache because there could genuinely be users or miners that are both signaling Lot True and don't realize they're signaling different Lot Trues. Even though I think we can expect a lot of the node runners and the miners to at least have some idea of what's going on, to understand all of the little nuances I think is probably too far. And again, it's important to keep in mind this is all regarding the fail safe method. So I actually think we will see activation incredibly quickly and a Lot true or false aspect will not actually even come into play. There is broad support. Miners have already demonstrated this. Users have to. The code has been reviewed and tested at great length. This has been going on for years. And again, it does not put any old users at risk to run this code on the network. So this is all a question about how and when to turn it on. Now, I don't know if this is too much of an added complication, and because there isn't such a forceful push, this isn't such a public and contentious or widespread debate going on. This isn't the scaling wars, right? This isn't the block size debate. Nobody's thinking, oh, I must run a node immediately to defend the network from an attacker, which is very much the perception and drive that was going on during 2017. So because of that, maybe there isn't enough push for this to actually work. But my thoughts I really prefer a separate client. I want to avoid like I said, I want to avoid the perception that Core is making this choice for the network or for the users. And I am fine with maybe a few devs making their own client, which is just a copy paste of whatever the next Core release is and call it bitcoin tap route. And maybe there's just a bar across the top that has a tap root activation switch for true or false, it allows you to signal with your node or minor whether you are lot True or Lot False displays how many blocks in the last 2016, the two week period? How many have signaled for lot True or Lot False or just tap root? In general, I don't think it should show nodes how many nodes are signaling for it. If somebody wants to go to a Block Explorer or some other website or something that aggregates that data, sure they can, but that civil attack vulnerable or whatever, so I don't think that matters. I think the key element here is how many blocks are signaling, but it should just allow the client to decide for itself whether they will reject non upgraded blocks at the end of the year or not. And then there's a countdown for how much longer they have left to decide. Clearly this still comes with a lot of risk, all of it does, but it means that we could turn it off quickly in the case of some crazy disaster or really dangerous signaling threshold, like 45% or something, something right in the middle, that just makes it the worst case scenario. But if we're at a year and we have 89% blocks, everyone can just turn it on and be done with it. I really liked that the BIP 148 client was not released by Core. So this was in the heat of scaling wars, right? So even though Big Blockers will still endlessly claim Core hijack the network or Block Stream, I can't remember exactly what the narrative is. They have to do so by claiming that every single UASF node runner was, I guess, a robot or infested with nanobots and unable to make their own decisions, and Block Stream somehow forced them to install an entirely separate client on their computers. They basically have to argue that even though a large subset of people disagreed with them, and explicitly so, that they went to a completely different location and downloaded a client that both blockstream and the greater the overwhelming majority of the dev community said don't install and don't use. Understand, neither actually supported the UASF client until at the very end, when it was clear that it was now less dangerous to support the UASF client than. It was to actually go against it or not install it again. They only ever supported the least risky outcome, and I think that's a really good defense against the perception that anyone is forcing anything to happen on the network. And Big Blockers can still make that claim all day long. But basically it's reliant on the silly notion that surely a lot of people agreed and would even go and download a completely separate client in support of that disagreement, but that it wasn't real consensus because it wasn't their opinion that they supported. But there's no contention here. None of this battle is here. Regarding Taproot, I think we just really kind of have some PTSD about the whole situation. And when we are dealing with this much money and a system and network that people are so deeply attached to and is so important for so many of us and so much riding on the line, even the tiniest of choices can end up with pretty serious arguments. And this is a good thing, right? This is great. We don't want to treat this thing carelessly. I mean, we're not a theorem, for crying out loud. And the worst case scenario here is a permanent fork with a minority Lot True chain. If not true. Is activated. But it's only activated on like 40% of the miners and nodes or whatever it is. And they reject Lot false blocks or any other just non signaling blocks. Then there will be a split with two coins and as Aaron suggested. They would both fight for which one had the quote unquote real Bitcoin label. In my opinion, this is not a concern. This is not going to happen. I think we need to trust the miners and the node operators in making this decision. ",

          "text": "a really, really important consideration, is to prevent a split in the Lot True community. That's something that Aaron talks about in this piece, and you can see a lot in the conversations and stuff, is that one of the issues here is that there will inevitably be a subset of the community, even if a Lot false client is released, that will still do Lot True. There is very likely going to be a subset of the community that picks Lot True and a subset that runs potentially their own client, if not false, gets chosen. And that could lead to a secondary argument, a splitting of the very users who actually do want to do Lot True, whether or not we would do lottru within the one year time period, or if we would do Lot True in the second time period following the first year lockout or first year timeout expiring. And I genuinely think that would lead to a bigger headache because there could genuinely be users or miners that are both signaling Lot True and don't realize they're signaling different Lot Trues. Even though I think we can expect a lot of the node runners and the miners to at least have some idea of what's going on, to understand all of the little nuances I think is probably too far. And again, it's important to keep in mind this is all regarding the fail safe method. So I actually think we will see activation incredibly quickly and a Lot true or false aspect will not actually even come into play. There is broad support. Miners have already demonstrated this. Users have to. The code has been reviewed and tested at great length. This has been going on for years. And again, it does not put any old users at risk to run this code on the network. So this is all a question about how and when to turn it on. Now, I don't know if this is too much of an added complication, and because there isn't such a forceful push, this isn't such a public and contentious or widespread debate going on. This isn't the scaling wars, right? This isn't the block size debate. Nobody's thinking, oh, I must run a node immediately to defend the network from an attacker, which is very much the perception and drive that was going on during 2017. So because of that, maybe there isn't enough push for this to actually work. But my thoughts I really prefer a separate client. I want to avoid like I said, I want to avoid the perception that Core is making this choice for the network or for the users. And I am fine with maybe a few devs making their own client, which is just a copy paste of whatever the next Core release is and call it bitcoin tap route. And maybe there's just a bar across the top that has a tap root activation switch for true or false, it allows you to signal with your node or minor whether you are lot True or Lot False displays how many blocks in the last 2016, the two week period? How many have signaled for lot True or Lot False or just tap root? In general, I don't think it should show nodes how many nodes are signaling for it. If somebody wants to go to a Block Explorer or some other website or something that aggregates that data, sure they can, but that civil attack vulnerable or whatever, so I don't think that matters. I think the key element here is how many blocks are signaling, but it should just allow the client to decide for itself whether they will reject non upgraded blocks at the end of the year or not.

So altcoins have mostly diluted each other. The way altcoins market themselves generally is to highlight the shortcomings of Bitcoin as though it were old tech or boomeracoin, and then explain how they are better than Bitcoin.

They're sacrificing some degree of security, decentralization auditability, and so forth in order to achieve things like more features, more speed, or more throughput.

Crypto exchanges with numerous coins have an incentive to get you excited about new coins because they make money from trading volumes.

There's so many times that I come back to these ideas and I'll hear them again and maybe they'll stick a little bit harder the second or third time I've thought about them or read about them or something.

      "text": "network effect and the monetary feedback loop of having it own bitcoin, even if it's less elegant, which is actually not, I actually think it's way better. But even if it were a clunkier solution, it would still be the one that got adopted because the network and monetary dominance of bitcoin so far outpaces the others. Except that in reality it's actually a far better solution in my opinion, than the way it's done on shit coins. And an example I've used recently is that when you are trying to create smart contracts or create some app that's built, quote unquote, into the blockchain rather than on a layer on top of it. It actually has a negative feedback loop. So when one person gets one to work, like blockchains inherently don't scale, it is a terrible thing to run an application on. It's perfect for securing a money. You run an application off of it, tied to it with a hash, and you can do this completely securely. You can build this into the multi signature magic of bitcoin. This is the episode that we talk about with Nadav Cohen, with DLCs, PTLCs and all this stuff, and he says it's hot take, which I don't even think is a hot take. I think it's absolutely perfectly sensible and perfectly true, is that anything that you can do on an altcoin or shit coin is going to be done on bitcoin and can be done on bitcoin. And in addition, it will do it better because it won't bloat the underlying chain in order to get it done. So this is the negative feedback loop that I'm talking about with something like ethereum. So let's say Aetherium invents crypto kitties, right? And suddenly there's this hype bubble for crypto kitties. Well, let's say I had a decentralized exchange, or I had a little web service or distributed computing thing, whatever it was. I had something running on ethereum that I wanted to work and had been working pretty great for four or five months. And now crypto kitties comes along. I haven't done anything, I haven't changed anything. My shit's still running the same way it's always been. Crypto kitties comes along and suddenly nobody can use my service because I built my service into the foundation, into the actual blockchain, requiring updates to that ledger and requiring gas fees and all of this stuff. And because somebody else had some degree of popularity in their app, mine breaks. And we've seen this over and over and over again. This is happening right now with defy. That when somebody wants to speculate on sushi tokens by staking yams or whatever the hell it is with this unisop crap, is that now people to do regular stuff on ethereum are paying $50 fees. I've seen somebody posting $100 fees. I doubt that's the norm. But without a doubt to do some sort of large smart contract that you're writing and broadcasting to the chain, you could easily get that big. So the more popular and the more people try to use it, the worse it gets in exactly that capacity. And the exact opposite feedback loop is the case for something like lightning, which is able to do all of those things. So if somebody develops an application on lightning that becomes wildly popular and has tons of people send payments to it and open up channels and makes crack and have to do all these withdrawals to it and bitfinex and all of these things, and zap and strike if somebody finds a killer app for lightning, and I am using lightning, everything gets 100 times easier for me. The liquidity on lightning explodes. The reliability of being able to reach some customer explodes. The ability to make payments in any size gets that much easier and more reliable. All of it has a positive feedback loop because it births and multiplies the liquidity network around lightning because it's on a higher layer. Them being successful helps me rather than hurts me. So at the end of the day, throw out the fact that they don't care about their monetary policy. Throw out the fact that they've completely abandoned security and immutability for a politically decided monetary policy. Throw out the fact that they're completely trying to change the consensus model for the entire network and throwing all of their security and lending effect down the garbage. And at the end of the day, you still have something where the more people use it and the more successful it is, the crappier it is at doing the very job it's supposed to do. All the while you can't verify anything. You're still trusting like three people with some nodes. Now, it's going to be successful for quite some time. Again, I still expect the ignorance to be very pervasive, but nonetheless, in the long term, I wouldn't be holding any of it and I won't be. Now, all of that said, bitcoin has evolved. Like, I was even using the example of TCPIP that has had very minor changes, if any. It's basically a header format and like a communication, like how to block and orient communication, right? It's like how to do the handshake, basically. Well, bitcoin has actually evolved quite a bit. I would be very curious to actually compare the two. How many significant changes happened to IPV four versus bitcoin? Because bitcoin has had some pretty significant changes. The difference is that bitcoin changes within its consensus rules and it's already evolved in some pretty fascinating ways. And with taproot coming around the corner, it's continuing to do so. But that's the whole software. Look at the history of software. There's quite a few of them. And they're not insignificant upgrades. They were really major things that have made a lot of new things possible and will heavily increase both the efficiency of the system as a whole, the ability to interoperate with things, the ability to create more efficient second layers, and, you know, those things compound on each other. If you can get 20% better efficiency at the base layer, base layer, you can turn that into 100 x efficiency on the second layer. You get an order of magnitude improvement with even small improvements at the base layer. And the fact that we're getting pretty significant improvements at the base layer still is pretty awesome. But anyway, that's all. Just to address the fact that I think the misunderstanding of bitcoin can't evolve or that bitcoin doesn't evolve, is just painfully wrong. In multiple different ways. Specifically, it does evolve. It has evolved. It just does so slowly and very meticulously because it's a cryptographic and economic system that is defending an immutable money. You don't move fast and break things with that unless you're stupid. And in addition to that, protocols evolve in layers. And this is and will continue to be the very fascinating and far more robust shifts in how the bitcoin market and economy work when we're talking about things higher layers like lightning and side chains and DLCs and all of these things I've already gone on forever.

Quote while I recognize that bitcoin can be held offline via cold storage, I understand it is difficult to do and that very few people actually do it.

          "text": "network effect and the monetary feedback loop of having it own bitcoin, even if it's less elegant, which is actually not, I actually think it's way better. But even if it were a clunkier solution, it would still be the one that got adopted because the network and monetary dominance of bitcoin so far outpaces the others. Except that in reality it's actually a far better solution in my opinion, than the way it's done on shit coins. And an example I've used recently is that when you are trying to create smart contracts or create some app that's built, quote unquote, into the blockchain rather than on a layer on top of it. It actually has a negative feedback loop. So when one person gets one to work, like blockchains inherently don't scale, it is a terrible thing to run an application on. It's perfect for securing a money. You run an application off of it, tied to it with a hash, and you can do this completely securely. You can build this into the multi signature magic of bitcoin. This is the episode that we talk about with Nadav Cohen, with DLCs, PTLCs and all this stuff, and he says it's hot take, which I don't even think is a hot take. I think it's absolutely perfectly sensible and perfectly true, is that anything that you can do on an altcoin or shit coin is going to be done on bitcoin and can be done on bitcoin. And in addition, it will do it better because it won't bloat the underlying chain in order to get it done. So this is the negative feedback loop that I'm talking about with something like ethereum. So let's say Aetherium invents crypto kitties, right? And suddenly there's this hype bubble for crypto kitties. Well, let's say I had a decentralized exchange, or I had a little web service or distributed computing thing, whatever it was. I had something running on ethereum that I wanted to work and had been working pretty great for four or five months. And now crypto kitties comes along. I haven't done anything, I haven't changed anything. My shit's still running the same way it's always been. Crypto kitties comes along and suddenly nobody can use my service because I built my service into the foundation, into the actual blockchain, requiring updates to that ledger and requiring gas fees and all of this stuff. And because somebody else had some degree of popularity in their app, mine breaks. And we've seen this over and over and over again. This is happening right now with defy. That when somebody wants to speculate on sushi tokens by staking yams or whatever the hell it is with this unisop crap, is that now people to do regular stuff on ethereum are paying $50 fees. I've seen somebody posting $100 fees. I doubt that's the norm. But without a doubt to do some sort of large smart contract that you're writing and broadcasting to the chain, you could easily get that big. So the more popular and the more people try to use it, the worse it gets in exactly that capacity. And the exact opposite feedback loop is the case for something like lightning, which is able to do all of those things. So if somebody develops an application on lightning that becomes wildly popular and has tons of people send payments to it and open up channels and makes crack and have to do all these withdrawals to it and bitfinex and all of these things, and zap and strike if somebody finds a killer app for lightning, and I am using lightning, everything gets 100 times easier for me. The liquidity on lightning explodes. The reliability of being able to reach some customer explodes. The ability to make payments in any size gets that much easier and more reliable. All of it has a positive feedback loop because it births and multiplies the liquidity network around lightning because it's on a higher layer. Them being successful helps me rather than hurts me. So at the end of the day, throw out the fact that they don't care about their monetary policy. Throw out the fact that they've completely abandoned security and immutability for a politically decided monetary policy. Throw out the fact that they're completely trying to change the consensus model for the entire network and throwing all of their security and lending effect down the garbage. And at the end of the day, you still have something where the more people use it and the more successful it is, the crappier it is at doing the very job it's supposed to do. All the while you can't verify anything. You're still trusting like three people with some nodes. Now, it's going to be successful for quite some time. Again, I still expect the ignorance to be very pervasive, but nonetheless, in the long term, I wouldn't be holding any of it and I won't be. Now, all of that said, bitcoin has evolved. Like, I was even using the example of TCPIP that has had very minor changes, if any. It's basically a header format and like a communication, like how to block and orient communication, right? It's like how to do the handshake, basically. Well, bitcoin has actually evolved quite a bit. I would be very curious to actually compare the two. How many significant changes happened to IPV four versus bitcoin? Because bitcoin has had some pretty significant changes. The difference is that bitcoin changes within its consensus rules and it's already evolved in some pretty fascinating ways. And with taproot coming around the corner, it's continuing to do so. But that's the whole software. Look at the history of software. There's quite a few of them. And they're not insignificant upgrades. They were really major things that have made a lot of new things possible and will heavily increase both the efficiency of the system as a whole, the ability to interoperate with things, the ability to create more efficient second layers, and, you know, those things compound on each other. If you can get 20% better efficiency at the base layer, base layer, you can turn that into 100 x efficiency on the second layer. You get an order of magnitude improvement with even small improvements at the base layer. And the fact that we're getting pretty significant improvements at the base layer still is pretty awesome. But anyway, that's all. Just to address the fact that I think the misunderstanding of bitcoin can't evolve or that bitcoin doesn't evolve, is just painfully wrong. In multiple different ways. Specifically, it does evolve. It has evolved. It just does so slowly and very meticulously because it's a cryptographic and economic system that is defending an immutable money. You don't move fast and break things with that unless you're stupid. And in addition to that, protocols evolve in layers. And this is and will continue to be the very fascinating and far more robust shifts in how the bitcoin market and economy work when we're talking about things higher layers like lightning and side chains and DLCs and all of these things I've already gone on forever. So let me try to finish up these last few criticisms. He says here we go. Problem of hacking here. Okay.

One of the things that I find fascinating about all of this and I truly try to remove myself for a second of my own bias and just think of it's very obvious that there's a 150,000,000 people, I think at this point is the estimate that hold bitcoin and kind of our bitcoiners, whether they identify that or not, they have bitcoin. And it seems like the only other asset in the market that maybe half or more seem to be okay with or kind of hold their nose and say like all right, that's fine, is stablecoins. Now we talked last time about the idea of potentially building stable coins on top of lightning via Tarot and all that. How do you think about stablecoins fitting into this? And is stablecoins part of the bitcoin story or is it something like that gets bifurcated away over time? So we think about the separation or the existence of two things in bitcoin, which is BTC, the asset, and then this stack of protocols that make up the financial network of BTC. And so to give people access to that financial network, to bitcoin core or to lightning network, the payments network in a way that suits their needs, I think is really important. It's nonjudgmental, it allows more people to participate and it doesn't demand of them that they fit a certain mold. And so I think in that sense that stable coins on lightning or in a bitcoin environment really fit with the bitcoin ethos all the way back into the very earliest sort of formation of what bitcoin ethos was and how Satoshi proposed to the cipher pumps forum it would be used. And so while in 2009, it was probably hard to imagine stablecoins, and I haven't read the chats in a long time, although when I started in bitcoin, that's where I started. But I don't think that there were reference to stable coins on bitcoin in the chat, but I imagine if there were, that they would have been well received, because the mission of bitcoin was to have as many people across the world, including in a free and fair financial system. And so stablecoins are a path to that. Of course, stablecoins are different than bitcoin, and that there's a centralized agency that acts as an issuer. And so I understand some folks having hesitancy around that. And of course, if you're comparing it to a pristine asset like bitcoin, it makes sense to have hesitancy for sure. But I think when you're living in an emerging market and your options are using cash locally on the street. And that cash could be declining in terms of its purchasing power. Or using USB. Which is more stable than many emerging market currencies using USB on lightning. Then the trade offs of using something that relies on a centralized issuer versus BTC that has volatility. I think for that family. Those trade offs are going to be defined in a different way. And I wouldn't want to impose my own values on that or my own decisions on that. I would leave that to each family to do themselves, and I'm happy that they'll have those decisions to make soon. ",

      "text": "that's what I would choose to do. I also love the idea that what this essentially unlocks is more use cases for Bitcoin to actually be used in transactions, as you mentioned, like as pristine collateral, which is what it was designed to be. There are obviously so many steps and hurdles in the way talk to us maybe about from a legislative standpoint, anything that maybe could stand in the way or inhibit that from happening. Yeah, definitely. So when it comes to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac right now, the biggest hurdle in getting to where the products that I'm describing, which is forget about FICO, forget about W two, forget about pay stubs is this regulation that emerged after the housing crisis in 2008, DoddFrank act, and it's called ATR the ability to repay. So basically it's required by law that you provide to a lender proof that you have the ability to repay on your mortgage. So actually, it would be illegal for me to become a lender and say, hey, I'm going to give you a mortgage on your home. I see your Bitcoin collateral here. Thank you for this, but I don't need to see anything else that would be in a legal transaction in the eyes of the government because the borrower hasn't demonstrated an ability to repay. So we need to get over that hurdle if what I'm describing is going to eventually come to fruition. Now, there are some creative ways around this that I think some companies are starting to work on. Utilizing multi SIG becomes a really interesting part of the equation. But that's the biggest regulatory hurdle that I can see. The other one, of course, is what I described earlier of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac not recognizing crypto assets as an actual asset. They don't look at it the same as your checking account or your savings account. Again, Hoseki is solving that problem in real time and encourage everyone to check that out because it's pretty remarkable what they've been able to come with be able to generate essentially what looks like a bank statement based off of your treasure holdings or whatever else you're holding your Bitcoin. And I think that's a huge part of kind of what's next, even before we get to changing regulations. How does that work, though? Are those bank statements produced by Hasek, are those accepted by banks? Yeah, I mean, it's a really new product, but there's definitely been some case studies that have already been used where they've been submitted to underwriters and underwriters have accepted them. I mean, listen, there's a million different financial institutions that have their own little logo at the top that say, this is George McCale, this is the date, this is how much money he's got, all the requirements that this is the account number. Right. And these are the things that an underwriter. When they're looking at a bank statement, that's all they're checking, they're looking up for those parameters. It's something that Coinbase and treasure and any of these, wherever you're holding your Bitcoin, you just can't produce something like that that's going to be compliant, that an underwriter is going to look at and take seriously. And so they've definitely solved this real urgent market need to produce something that isn't going to raise any red flags. It's just going to say these are the assets, right? So, yeah, it's pretty remarkable. And I wish that underwriters for this type of thing were the same as underwriters for physical objects. Like, if you already looked into underwriters laboratories, like any electrical device has a little stamp on it, they do the craziest shit. It's like they put it in this giant furnace and they increase the temperature while running the electricity through and they're like, will they catch on fire? Who knows? Let's find out. And it's like, does this thing actually meet these specified standards? Like just the physical laws of the universe? Whereas financial underwriting is just so much hand waving. It really is. Yeah. And actually proof of reserves is actually, I think, one of the most powerful ways that an underwriter can demonstrate somebody's assets actually exist and are there so that they have access to them. Producing a bank account also kind of works. But again, it's like, if I can check in real time how much you have on your treasure, that's a different level of qualifying you than if you just send me a bank statement from 30 days ago. Man. It's also interesting, this is very much a side conversation. Maybe not, but just the Privacy implications of that. We spend so much time as Bitcoin ers, not reusing addresses, and that's the default in almost every wallet these days. Any modern Bitcoin wallet automatically generates a new hierarchically determined wallet address. And that is useful because otherwise on a blockchain and things for the audience, but obviously everyone in the call knows. But on a blockchain like Bitcoin, you can see the whole idea that everything is fully auditable. You can see every single transaction that ever happened on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin pizza day is on Sunday. And when you spin up your own node for the first time, you download the entire history of the blockchain from inception and you can literally go back and see the fucking transaction where that Bitcoin that pizza was purchased. And that's really fucking cool. But it also makes things like maintaining ones pseudo anonymity is relatively straightforward to maintain, although it's very actually essential. It's very difficult with all the KYC systems that have been implemented recently or more recently. But anyway, I just think about that. If you're basically putting up all your XP, all of your wallet addresses, how does that factor into and how will people make that decision? Right now? I think most the average person is very used to just of course everyone in the entire world has access to my bank account, or at least of course the government does or increase anybody who has access to my credit score. I wonder how that will shift in a Bitcoin world as we move into hyperbiquinization. Yeah, definitely. And that's a big part of sort of what I'm excited about is if we can get away from FICO scores and if we can get away from some of these legacy components, it does become a little bit more private. I mean, ultimately you're still providing some personal financial information, but maybe you don't have to provide your Social Security number anymore to a lender and so maybe you don't have to get KYC fully. You don't actually to get your proof of reserves document done. But you do have to your point, there is some Privacy that you're giving up by providing your X tubs and wallet addresses in order to get this done. But it is an improvement on sort of a full KYC process. I want to be very clear, it is a massive improvement. It's a huge improvement. Right now, your credit score, when you apply for a loan, it's like, as you said earlier, the amount of information you have to give up, it's fucking insane. I had to restrain myself not to make a joke about like, yeah, you also have to give your DNA sample and your firstborn child and all that shit, but you have to give everything in any centralized system where that stuff is being collected or exposed, they will eventually be hacked and that information will just become someone else's information. So this would be a massive improvement. I was thinking about this too. Obviously yours in Bitcoin is collateral and whether it's a two or three multi SEG, assuming one key that you have one key that the bank has, and then one key, let's just say lawyer has just to keep it simple or an arbitrary or whatever. Imagine you get to a point where like, you feel the bank is doing something dishonest to you or the bank feels like you're doing something dishonest, but then they lose the fee phrase or they misplace it with someone else's feet phrase and it's like, oh, well, we want this. And I don't know, you get into hairy situations where the lawyer could collude with you or it gets like, or maybe the Bitcoin is lost so you're like, doing this loan against something you thought that you have and you both lost it, or something happens where you basically can't unlock these funds. So you've been basically living in a house, and they're like, oh, yeah, it's good you've been paying the Fiat or whatever loan terms you have. But then they're like, hey, we're trying to margin call you, and they can't actually use it to take advantage of it. So I think that would be a very interesting spot to be in. There's a lot of really interesting stuff you can do, though, even with Taproot, but certainly with Covenant, which is a big separate thing in the Bitcoin world now. But you can do this right now with Tap is my understanding you can have, like, decaying multi SIG set up. So again, for the audience, a multi SIG set up is where you have multiple private keys which are required in order to spend your Bitcoin. So you can have a two or three multi SIG where you have three different hardware wallets or three different private keys, and then two of those three are required. You can do three of five, you can do seven of ten whatever you want. But there are ways of setting it up so that if it's a two of three multi SIG, and then but after three years or a year or six months or a week, it decays to one of three or whatever you want to however you want to set it up. And there's also you could do all sorts of interesting payout schemes where it's like you are signing a transaction that guarantees that every month, like, a certain amount of this Bitcoin will be available to be reclaimed. If X, Y and Z, like, you can do all that shit on Bitcoin. So I think we're going to see more and more kind of novel smart contracts on Bitcoin with Taproot and Schnor that we do. Yeah. We'll be able to find the balance between just being able to be like, well, if my lawyer and other person collude, like, I lose all my Bitcoin, you'll be able to set it up in these, like, multiple sign transaction ways. I'll go real quick, George, and I'll swing it back over to you. But I can definitely see, well, that's cool. And there'll be a lot of people that do clever things without a doubt. Can be something like, I fat fingered, I only wanted a year, and I put ten years without a doubt going to be things like that that occur. You know what I mean? Oh, no, 100%. But I mean, that's why we're seeing all these really interesting businesses build out like Casa Unchained. There's other ones as well, where their entire business model, which is extremely valuable, is we help you set up a secure, safe, multisig Bitcoin situation where you are not Bitcoin is about radical personal responsibility, right. If you fuck it up when you're setting up your hardware wallet, your Bitcoin is gone. Which is why it's like when I set up many years ago, when I set up my first hardware wallet, it was like I spun it up. I made sure I understood my seed phrase. I wrote it down, I wiped the wallet. I restored it. I did all this. I sent a test transaction. I sent another one. I sent it back. I fucked it up. I learned that's a lot of work, and there is a lot of value in these services that are very trustworthy businesses where, again, like, cost on a chain, they'll help you set up a two or three multi stick where they are one of the key holders, and they have all these additional systems in place that make that a system where you can just show up and be like, make my shit secure, and they'll do it for you. I think we're gonna see the same things with these types of systems that we're talking about now. So I think in the near future, you won't have to kind of go with alone, so to speak, if you don't want to. Yeah, I think it would be cool, too, if on the sort of positive end of that as the price appreciates both a Bitcoin or maybe your house or you hit a certain number of payments into your loan terms. You slowly get you set up like a smart contract that you're describing fee where you hit these triggers, and then your Bitcoin collateral is automatically released back to you're in full custody. It would be legit. I think that's ultimately, kind of if you're holding Bitcoin for the long term, the beauty of this product I'm describing is if you can protect your downside enough to where there's no liquidation trigger and you're taking an acceptable amount of risk and you're able to service the debt. So now your Bitcoin is just being used utilized as collateral, but you're not spending it. And so even in a down market, you're okay, and you still keep your house. You keep your Bitcoin as long as you make payments. And then on the upside, you're basically in Fiat terms, your debt is dwindling to nothing because the Bitcoin is appreciating so much. And so that collateral could be released back to you as your LTV is lower and lower. It's going to be really interesting to see how the incentives in the game theory plays out right now. At the end of the day. If. You want to buy a house like all of us, unless you're like a fucking Kajillionaire, you kind of do whatever you like. The businesses, the governments, the municipalities get to do whatever they want, right? They're like, use the terms. And if you don't like them, you can shop around a little bit. But ultimately, it's like, this is what you're going to get, and you take it or leave it, and it's going to be very interesting to see how that dynamic shifts over time. And you have lenders desperately trying to incentivize Bitcoiners to collateralize their loans with Bitcoin. I think that will be a very fun thing to see. You put up the age now of you sign a contract that puts up or uses your Bitcoin as collateral in a lump sum, and then over time, it's released to you. I can also imagine it going the other way, where it's like entities are like, Yo, you get to live in this house for free, and then each month you kind of like collateralize a little bit more of the house with your Bitcoin so that if you don't pay us back within six months, we get to keep your Bitcoin. Like, please, please take this. You know what I mean? I'm sure George knows this, but probably in maybe July or August of 2020, when the market was really starting to take off in the housing market, at least that's when I started looking. There were deals literally like that. They're like, all right, no closing costs. We pay for all of that. I heard people getting vacations. They're like, we'll pay for your vacation for $2,000 wherever you want to go. We'll throw in the plane tickets, we'll throw in the hotels. They were like, trying to get all these one ups to just get the house. They're like, we'll give you an all cash offer and this and that and this. It was insane. And I'm sure George can relate to some of those stories. Oh, man, they're desperate, that's for sure. I mean, it was so much worse ten years ago before we used to have people that these liar loans or these stated income, stated asset loans that you wouldn't believe the kind of stuff we would approve because all you really needed back then was literally just a credit score, a credit report, and you didn't need anything else. And you qualify for a home, basically for however much you wanted, however much you said that you made. There was a moment in time where it was illegal as a loan originated to ask for a statement to back up what a borrower was saying because you risk discrimination. Like, why did you ask this guy, not this guy? People just come in and say whatever, and we wonder how we got to where we got all that time ago. But that's neither here nor there. Now. It's a very different world. One thing I want to make sure I say for any of this listing is if you qualify for a traditional loan today and you want to buy a house, you should just get a traditional loan. That's probably going to be your best bet, right? It's still really early now if you can use your Bitcoin as an asset just to qualify for your loan, but without actually having to use it, which can sometimes make the difference in your buying power. Again, with keep plugging Hoseki. I'm helping those guys, and I really like what we're building. The product is really important. But if you can use something like that to qualify, then that's a huge win if you don't have to spend it. So this conversation kind of goes beyond just like the Bitcoin back mortgage loans. There's a lot of nuance and a lot of different opportunities. But the point is if you're a bitcoinner and you have a W to job and you can qualify for the house that you want to buy and get a Fanny Freddie loan, that's probably going to be your best bet today in today's market. But this is very much a future oriented conversation of where things are headed and ",

          "text": "that's what I would choose to do. I also love the idea that what this essentially unlocks is more use cases for Bitcoin to actually be used in transactions, as you mentioned, like as pristine collateral, which is what it was designed to be. There are obviously so many steps and hurdles in the way talk to us maybe about from a legislative standpoint, anything that maybe could stand in the way or inhibit that from happening. Yeah, definitely. So when it comes to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac right now, the biggest hurdle in getting to where the products that I'm describing, which is forget about FICO, forget about W two, forget about pay stubs is this regulation that emerged after the housing crisis in 2008, DoddFrank act, and it's called ATR the ability to repay. So basically it's required by law that you provide to a lender proof that you have the ability to repay on your mortgage. So actually, it would be illegal for me to become a lender and say, hey, I'm going to give you a mortgage on your home. I see your Bitcoin collateral here. Thank you for this, but I don't need to see anything else that would be in a legal transaction in the eyes of the government because the borrower hasn't demonstrated an ability to repay. So we need to get over that hurdle if what I'm describing is going to eventually come to fruition. Now, there are some creative ways around this that I think some companies are starting to work on. Utilizing multi SIG becomes a really interesting part of the equation. But that's the biggest regulatory hurdle that I can see. The other one, of course, is what I described earlier of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac not recognizing crypto assets as an actual asset. They don't look at it the same as your checking account or your savings account. Again, Hoseki is solving that problem in real time and encourage everyone to check that out because it's pretty remarkable what they've been able to come with be able to generate essentially what looks like a bank statement based off of your treasure holdings or whatever else you're holding your Bitcoin. And I think that's a huge part of kind of what's next, even before we get to changing regulations. How does that work, though? Are those bank statements produced by Hasek, are those accepted by banks? Yeah, I mean, it's a really new product, but there's definitely been some case studies that have already been used where they've been submitted to underwriters and underwriters have accepted them. I mean, listen, there's a million different financial institutions that have their own little logo at the top that say, this is George McCale, this is the date, this is how much money he's got, all the requirements that this is the account number. Right. And these are the things that an underwriter. When they're looking at a bank statement, that's all they're checking, they're looking up for those parameters. It's something that Coinbase and treasure and any of these, wherever you're holding your Bitcoin, you just can't produce something like that that's going to be compliant, that an underwriter is going to look at and take seriously. And so they've definitely solved this real urgent market need to produce something that isn't going to raise any red flags. It's just going to say these are the assets, right? So, yeah, it's pretty remarkable. And I wish that underwriters for this type of thing were the same as underwriters for physical objects. Like, if you already looked into underwriters laboratories, like any electrical device has a little stamp on it, they do the craziest shit. It's like they put it in this giant furnace and they increase the temperature while running the electricity through and they're like, will they catch on fire? Who knows? Let's find out. And it's like, does this thing actually meet these specified standards? Like just the physical laws of the universe? Whereas financial underwriting is just so much hand waving. It really is. Yeah. And actually proof of reserves is actually, I think, one of the most powerful ways that an underwriter can demonstrate somebody's assets actually exist and are there so that they have access to them. Producing a bank account also kind of works. But again, it's like, if I can check in real time how much you have on your treasure, that's a different level of qualifying you than if you just send me a bank statement from 30 days ago. Man. It's also interesting, this is very much a side conversation. Maybe not, but just the Privacy implications of that. We spend so much time as Bitcoin ers, not reusing addresses, and that's the default in almost every wallet these days. Any modern Bitcoin wallet automatically generates a new hierarchically determined wallet address. And that is useful because otherwise on a blockchain and things for the audience, but obviously everyone in the call knows. But on a blockchain like Bitcoin, you can see the whole idea that everything is fully auditable. You can see every single transaction that ever happened on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin pizza day is on Sunday. And when you spin up your own node for the first time, you download the entire history of the blockchain from inception and you can literally go back and see the fucking transaction where that Bitcoin that pizza was purchased. And that's really fucking cool. But it also makes things like maintaining ones pseudo anonymity is relatively straightforward to maintain, although it's very actually essential. It's very difficult with all the KYC systems that have been implemented recently or more recently. But anyway, I just think about that. If you're basically putting up all your XP, all of your wallet addresses, how does that factor into and how will people make that decision? Right now? I think most the average person is very used to just of course everyone in the entire world has access to my bank account, or at least of course the government does or increase anybody who has access to my credit score. I wonder how that will shift in a Bitcoin world as we move into hyperbiquinization. Yeah, definitely. And that's a big part of sort of what I'm excited about is if we can get away from FICO scores and if we can get away from some of these legacy components, it does become a little bit more private. I mean, ultimately you're still providing some personal financial information, but maybe you don't have to provide your Social Security number anymore to a lender and so maybe you don't have to get KYC fully. You don't actually to get your proof of reserves document done. But you do have to your point, there is some Privacy that you're giving up by providing your X tubs and wallet addresses in order to get this done. But it is an improvement on sort of a full KYC process. I want to be very clear, it is a massive improvement. It's a huge improvement. Right now, your credit score, when you apply for a loan, it's like, as you said earlier, the amount of information you have to give up, it's fucking insane. I had to restrain myself not to make a joke about like, yeah, you also have to give your DNA sample and your firstborn child and all that shit, but you have to give everything in any centralized system where that stuff is being collected or exposed, they will eventually be hacked and that information will just become someone else's information. So this would be a massive improvement. I was thinking about this too. Obviously yours in Bitcoin is collateral and whether it's a two or three multi SEG, assuming one key that you have one key that the bank has, and then one key, let's just say lawyer has just to keep it simple or an arbitrary or whatever. Imagine you get to a point where like, you feel the bank is doing something dishonest to you or the bank feels like you're doing something dishonest, but then they lose the fee phrase or they misplace it with someone else's feet phrase and it's like, oh, well, we want this. And I don't know, you get into hairy situations where the lawyer could collude with you or it gets like, or maybe the Bitcoin is lost so you're like, doing this loan against something you thought that you have and you both lost it, or something happens where you basically can't unlock these funds. So you've been basically living in a house, and they're like, oh, yeah, it's good you've been paying the Fiat or whatever loan terms you have. But then they're like, hey, we're trying to margin call you, and they can't actually use it to take advantage of it. So I think that would be a very interesting spot to be in. There's a lot of really interesting stuff you can do, though, even with Taproot, but certainly with Covenant, which is a big separate thing in the Bitcoin world now. But you can do this right now with Tap is my understanding you can have, like, decaying multi SIG set up. So again, for the audience, a multi SIG set up is where you have multiple private keys which are required in order to spend your Bitcoin. So you can have a two or three multi SIG where you have three different hardware wallets or three different private keys, and then two of those three are required. You can do three of five, you can do seven of ten whatever you want. But there are ways of setting it up so that if it's a two of three multi SIG, and then but after three years or a year or six months or a week, it decays to one of three or whatever you want to however you want to set it up. And there's also you could do all sorts of interesting payout schemes where it's like you are signing a transaction that guarantees that every month, like, a certain amount of this Bitcoin will be available to be reclaimed. If X, Y and Z, like, you can do all that shit on Bitcoin. So I think we're going to see more and more kind of novel smart contracts on Bitcoin with Taproot and Schnor that we do. Yeah. We'll be able to find the balance between just being able to be like, well, if my lawyer and other person collude, like, I lose all my Bitcoin, you'll be able to set it up in these, like, multiple sign transaction ways. I'll go real quick, George, and I'll swing it back over to you. But I can definitely see, well, that's cool. And there'll be a lot of people that do clever things without a doubt. Can be something like, I fat fingered, I only wanted a year, and I put ten years without a doubt going to be things like that that occur. You know what I mean? Oh, no, 100%. But I mean, that's why we're seeing all these really interesting businesses build out like Casa Unchained. There's other ones as well, where their entire business model, which is extremely valuable, is we help you set up a secure, safe, multisig Bitcoin situation where you are not Bitcoin is about radical personal responsibility, right. If you fuck it up when you're setting up your hardware wallet, your Bitcoin is gone. Which is why it's like when I set up many years ago, when I set up my first hardware wallet, it was like I spun it up. I made sure I understood my seed phrase. I wrote it down, I wiped the wallet. I restored it. I did all this. I sent a test transaction. I sent another one. I sent it back. I fucked it up. I learned that's a lot of work, and there is a lot of value in these services that are very trustworthy businesses where, again, like, cost on a chain, they'll help you set up a two or three multi stick where they are one of the key holders, and they have all these additional systems in place that make that a system where you can just show up and be like, make my shit secure, and they'll do it for you. I think we're gonna see the same things with these types of systems that we're talking about now. So I think in the near future, you won't have to kind of go with alone, so to speak, if you don't want to. Yeah, I think it would be cool, too, if on the sort of positive end of that as the price appreciates both a Bitcoin or maybe your house or you hit a certain number of payments into your loan terms. You slowly get you set up like a smart contract that you're describing fee where you hit these triggers, and then your Bitcoin collateral is automatically released back to you're in full custody. It would be legit. I think that's ultimately, kind of if you're holding Bitcoin for the long term, the beauty of this product I'm describing is if you can protect your downside enough to where there's no liquidation trigger and you're taking an acceptable amount of risk and you're able to service the debt. So now your Bitcoin is just being used utilized as collateral, but you're not spending it. And so even in a down market, you're okay, and you still keep your house. You keep your Bitcoin as long as you make payments. And then on the upside, you're basically in Fiat terms, your debt is dwindling to nothing because the Bitcoin is appreciating so much. And so that collateral could be released back to you as your LTV is lower and lower. It's going to be really interesting to see how the incentives in the game theory plays out right now. At the end of the day. If. You want to buy a house like all of us, unless you're like a fucking Kajillionaire, you kind of do whatever you like. The businesses, the governments, the municipalities get to do whatever they want, right? They're like, use the terms. And if you don't like them, you can shop around a little bit. But ultimately, it's like, this is what you're going to get, and you take it or leave it, and it's going to be very interesting to see how that dynamic shifts over time. And you have lenders desperately trying to incentivize Bitcoiners to collateralize their loans with Bitcoin. I think that will be a very fun thing to see. You put up the age now of you sign a contract that puts up or uses your Bitcoin as collateral in a lump sum, and then over time, it's released to you. I can also imagine it going the other way, where it's like entities are like, Yo, you get to live in this house for free, and then each month you kind of like collateralize a little bit more of the house with your Bitcoin so that if you don't pay us back within six months, we get to keep your Bitcoin. Like, please, please take this. You know what I mean? I'm sure George knows this, but probably in maybe July or August of 2020, when the market was really starting to take off in the housing market, at least that's when I started looking. There were deals literally like that. They're like, all right, no closing costs. We pay for all of that. I heard people getting vacations. They're like, we'll pay for your vacation for $2,000 wherever you want to go. We'll throw in the plane tickets, we'll throw in the hotels. They were like, trying to get all these one ups to just get the house. They're like, we'll give you an all cash offer and this and that and this. It was insane. And I'm sure George can relate to some of those stories. Oh, man, they're desperate, that's for sure. I mean, it was so much worse ten years ago before we used to have people that these liar loans or these stated income, stated asset loans that you wouldn't believe the kind of stuff we would approve because all you really needed back then was literally just a credit score, a credit report, and you didn't need anything else.

There will be lots of awesome stuff built on top of bitcoin.

Look now. Like, I use Lightning Network literally every day. It's not perfect.

So having some access to a US dollar on a permissionless network, something like Tarot, can be useful for a lot of people. And when the point comes where people might prefer to hold their wealth in bitcoin, they're already using it. So it's just a simple even like liquid network. For something like USDT, you don't need absolute permissionlessness and decentralization to hold a stablecoin because it's just dollars in somebody else's bank account anyways. Yeah, so something like the liquid network just gives you the ability to have like a bitcoin native coin dollar until SATS become a stable coin, which is like maybe 2030 or something, then people do need to have these types of things. And if we're going digital, a lot of bitcoin ers, kind of resist some of these concepts like digital game items and then NFT art or whatever. It's just like collectibles if we're going digital. If everything is going digital, it does make sense that you would want to have your Starbucks points in your bitcoin wallet or your stock in your bitcoin wallet. And it doesn't have to be as permissionless and decentralized as the base layer bitcoin.

      "text": "now this kind of ties into the discussion around stable coins and specifically stable coins on lightning have been getting quite a bit of steam in the last 612 months. I think the Human Rights Foundation has a bounty up for stabilized lightning. Synonym is working on bringing tether to lightning. We have Tarot bringing all sorts of assets to lightning impact. Before we get into the impact, what do you think got this push to stable coins? What was the catalyst here for lightning stablecoins. Why is this now such an important thing in your mind? Well, I've been bullish on stablecoins for a few years now. It's kind of the one area outside of Bitcoin that I've been bullish on, even though they started on Bitcoin, but just primarily right now they're not on Bitcoin because Bitcoin is not optimal for being the base for them. People prefer to use them on other blockchains. And I think for obvious reasons, one is because Bitcoin is still volatile and because it has tax issues, having blockchain rails with account is useful to a lot of people. Right. And so a lot of people need dollars for various reasons. And so stable coins are useful. And I mean, for example, if you're in Lebanon and if you have dollars in your bank, they can be confiscated. So something like Tether or USDC, despite any risks they have with their collateral quality, are certainly seem like less of a risk than in some of these banks. Right. So people are willing to take those risks also, over time, back in the early days, Bitcoin was used as unit of account in crypto trading. So if you wanted to buy an Altcoin and sell an Altcoin, it'd be against that Bitcoin pair. And with the invention and proliferation of stablecoins, Bitcoin kind of lost that status. And you made stable coins and just dollars in general, the unit of account for all that kind of crypto trading. And so most of the stable coin usage is not really for medium exchange. It's for trading liquidity, it's for trading unit of account, basically getting back to cash and then getting back into whatever speculation that they want to do for the next period of time. But we do see around the margins that there is some usage of them as medium exchange, especially in developing countries or especially if you want to send value globally. Right. It's just a much easier experience. And then, of course, regulators are looking at that. It's kind of this open thing that's kind of the tug of war between users and regulators. And we'll see how they catch up. What lighting does is lighting says, okay, well, here's the cheapest, fastest way to send value. And now you can combine it, or at least you will be able to combine it with stable coins. Right. And so I think the implications are obvious for I mean, there's a reason. So, for example, stable coins for while they were heavy on Ethereum, then they still are. But they also spilled over in a Tron. And the question is, why do they spill over to Tron? It's like, well, because they don't want to pay $50 to send a $50 transaction. Right. You can only do large stablecoin transactions on Ethereum because of the speed and the throughput and things like that. But with lightning having nearly unlimited throughput and speed with low fees, especially as liquidity grows, that is a very attractive kind of underlying layer to have stable coins run over. And so to the extent that stablecoins can return to Bitcoin, I'd be happy to see that. And I think that at least for that medium exchange element, they are a useful bridge between now and whatever future is where Bitcoin is more widely held and more kind of stable and more clear from a regulatory standpoint. And more people understand it. I think the ability to exchange value stable value over Bitcoin rails is very useful. So I'm pretty bullish on stablecoins on lightning. How much of that? I think the stablecoin market today is about $200 billion or somewhere around there. How much of that $200 billion do you think flows towards lightning, given that this is probably going to be used primarily for payments rather than some of those trading use cases for borrowing and lending? So I think not a lot at first. Right. That's also why I think the comparisons of say people are like people in altcoin spaces will say lightning doesn't matter because look how small the total locked value is. But they're comparing it to basic casino, they're comparing it to a leveraging and like trading environment. Right. So I think that just like that this will also be kind of slow just to start out. Right. I think it's going back to that freight rate analogy. I think that it starts slow, but it just picks up a lot of momentum. And so because there's not some huge massive arbitrage incentive thing to get people in, they're not coming into it to gamble for the most part. I think that people come into it when they need it. And so I think it's going to be one of those things that just keeps grinding up over time rather than some immediate explosive burst when it comes out. So I think for a while or for kind of foreseeable future, the percentage stable coins on lightning probably won't be huge, but I think that will be disproportionately weighted towards more valuable use cases. Right. I think that giving emerging market people more access to payments is more valuable than having whales doing arbitrage in D Phi, for example, if you look at like chain analysis does statistics, they look into defy and it's almost entirely like institutions and Wales, these large funds playing around and arbitraging things. It's this big circular kind of speculation thing. There's very limited use case for the little guy. Right. So actual kind of practical real world things. And so I think going back to that, lightning has a higher ratio of speculation to utility, so a higher ratio of utility speculation, we can say, I think that whatever usage is on lightning will be a more valuable usage and it's there for people when they need it once that capability is developed and. Over time, do you think let's take a look at something like Tarot where you can issue all sorts of assets, maybe all the Fiat currencies that exist today can be issued on lightning. What do you think that does to existing Fiat payment rails? Like which rails are going to be the most impacted by a transition of Fiat currencies onto lightning. So I think the traditional payment rails can be impacted unless they adapt to it pretty quickly. But again, I think that will take time because there are huge entrenched advantages network effects of the existing things like Visa and all that. So they have this thing where they charge pretty high fees, but they also give people pretty significant rewards, for example, on their credit cards and things like that. And so over time, I think we'll see more and more growth coming from Lightning oriented payments compared to the legacy players. But I don't think it's like a light switch where it all just kind of rapidly goes over there. I think that some of those just the growth can be unimpressive, while the growth that we can see in Lightning can be much faster, and especially when relatively tech savvy people look at the differences and especially if they want to do international payments. Right. It's just the frictions are much less. And so I think that it just can over time take market share by being more efficient and cheaper. And then you can also there are platforms to do rewards and things like that. I think over time we'll see more and more integration, and then we'll even see integration between those legacy players in Lightning, which we're already seeing to some extent. I think that's going to continue. And so I think that with something like cash out the fact that you can send value to any other cash app account, but then now also you can withdraw the Lightning and things like that. I think that's a very useful product to a lot of people. And then also people can go out of the custodial solutions and if they want to do all sorts of international things like that, that's now open for them. And of course that brings regulatory challenges, right? Because really what Bitcoin did was prior to Bitcoin was hard to send value internationally in large amounts. You could put a couple of dollars into an envelope and send it to Japan, for example. But other than that, it's hard to send liquid value long distances without using a bank intermediary. You had to go through a trusted centralized entity and they could just say no. Right. So if any country wants to impose regulations of where you can send money to or who you can send money to, they don't have to enforce that on the consumer layer. They can just tell the banks these are rules to follow. Whereas now that due to technology, consumers have direct consumer to consumer payments globally. And instead of relying on a trusted intermediate, they can say no, they're just relying on this decentralized network that doesn't really care. That opens up regulatory kind of questions about how governments are going to respond to that if it becomes larger and larger over time, where it's much harder for them to enforce because they have to enforce it on the consumer layer, which is obviously orders of magnitude more enforcement points than just telling a number of banks what their rules are. So I think that there are challenges ahead of the Lightning network, even though, I'm bullish on the whole space and the technology involved. ",

          "text": "now this kind of ties into the discussion around stable coins and specifically stable coins on lightning have been getting quite a bit of steam in the last 612 months. I think the Human Rights Foundation has a bounty up for stabilized lightning. Synonym is working on bringing tether to lightning. We have Tarot bringing all sorts of assets to lightning impact. Before we get into the impact, what do you think got this push to stable coins? What was the catalyst here for lightning stablecoins. Why is this now such an important thing in your mind? Well, I've been bullish on stablecoins for a few years now. It's kind of the one area outside of Bitcoin that I've been bullish on, even though they started on Bitcoin, but just primarily right now they're not on Bitcoin because Bitcoin is not optimal for being the base for them.

      "text": "And that's also one of the things where a lot is true and a lot is false. People differ in their opinions. A lot is false. Proponents like yourself argue against a lot is true because the change split was caused by a lot is true. And therefore, if we don't want change splits, we don't want a lot is true. And then the thing we just described won't happen. The worst case scenario is that we don't have Taproot. It will just expire. And that's not as bad as this poor Korean guy losing his honest days of work. Exactly. And we might have tapped it later. Now that a lot is true, proponents will argue, look, Bitcoin is an open network, and anyone can run any software they want. And for better or worse, what is true is a thing that exists. Now, if we want to avoid a chain split, the best way to avoid that is to make sure that everyone uses a Lot is true, or at least that the majority of miners upgrade in time. And Lot is true is the best way to ensure that. So getting critical mass for Lot is true is actually the saver option, despite the fact that Lot is true also introduced the risk. If I want to give an analogy, it's kind of like the world would be a safer place without nuclear weapons, but there are nuclear weapons, and it seems like it's safer to actually have one. In that case, I think that analogy. Breaks down very quickly. But yeah, I get the idea. But the point is that it's not a perfect analogy. I'm sure the point is Lodger exists, and now we have to deal with that. It might be a better world, it might be a safer place if lobbyists True didn't exist. If you a didn't exist, but it does. And now we have to sort of deal with that facts. And there's an argument to be made that making sure the software succeeds is actually the best way to go to save that poor Korean guy. Yeah, I'm always very skeptical of this type of game theory, because it sounds rhetorically nice, but I'm not sure if it's really true. And one of the obvious problems is how do you know you've reached the entire Bitcoin community? Because like we talked about this hypothetical person in his other country that's not reading Twitter and Reddit. He has no idea that this is going on, and let alone most of the lightweight wallet users. The number of people who use Bitcoin is much, much greater than the number of people who are even remotely interested in these discussions. And also to even explain the risk to those people, even if we could reach them to explain why they should upgrade. That alone is a rather big challenge, because in this episode we roughly try to explain what would go wrong if they don't upgrade, and we can't just tell them you must upgrade, because that sort of violates the idea that you persuade people with arguments and let them decide what they want to do rather than tell them based on authority. Well, keep in mind that in the end, all of this is afforded. If a majority of hash power upgrades and a lot is true. It actually is. Any majority would be fine in the end. Because if you manage themselves, use Lot is true, then they'll definitely get the long chain one by the end of the year. Yes. So the game theory is kind of narrow to saying, well, you want to convince the miners to do this. Yeah, pretty much. The problem, though, is if it fails, we just explained the disaster that happens. So then the question is, what is that risk? Can you put a percentage on that? Can you somehow simulate the world and find out what happens? No. Look, I'm kind of on the fence on this. I see compelling arguments on both sides. I was leaning towards Lottis false at first. But the more I think about it, the argument is if you include lot is true in Bitcoin and Core, then that's practically guarantees that everything will be fine because the economic majority will almost certainly run it exchanges and most users. Because that assumes that this economic majority is quick to upgrade and not sort of ignoring things. I don't know. There might be companies that are running three or four year old notes because they have 16 different chit coins. So even that I would not assume that we know from the network in general that lots of people don't upgrade nodes and that one year is pretty short. Yes. But you can't tell from the nodes whether they're the economic majority or not. That might just be a few critical players that would do the trick here. Yes, I can't be sure. I'm not sure. I'm speculating. I'm explaining the argument. But the opposite is also true, that now that lot is to exist, some group of users will almost certainly run it. And that introduces maybe greater risks than if it was included in Core, because that would increase the chances of success for a Lot is true, basically, or the hash. But it really depends. Majority upgrading. Yeah, it really depends on who that group is, because if that group is just some random people who are not economically important, then they're experiencing the problem. Nobody else notices anything. Yes, that's true. If it's a very small group, that might be true. But the question is how small or how big does that group need to be for this to become a problem? And because they have an asymmetric, is that the correct English word? Yeah, asymmetry there asymmetry. Yeah. They have this advantage because their chain can never be reorg the way or the law is false change, so it can be reorved away. That's true. But their chain might never grow. So that's also a risk. So I don't know if it's not a strict advantage. Right. Well, I think it's definitely a strict advantage. Well, I mean, the advantage is you can't be reworked. The disadvantage is your chain might never grow. And I don't know which of those. Two is it will probably grow. Right. It depends on how big that group is again. And that's not something we can objectively measure. No. I guess that's sort of what it comes down to either effectively we can't. Right. We still don't know what really cost the segregate activation even four years afterwards. So that gives you an idea of how difficult it is to know what these forces really are. Yes. Well, so that's where we agree. I think it's very difficult to know either way. Yeah. Not even there might still be a lot of true minority or maybe even majority that might still happen. Yeah. Another interesting thought experiment then is to say, well, okay, so there's always going to be a lot of true group for any soft work. But what about a software that has no community support? What about some arbitrary group of people just decides to run their own software because they want to maybe somebody wants to shrink the coin supply, set the coin issues to zero tomorrow, or reduce the block size to 300. They could say, well, because it's a Softwork and because I run a lot of strew node, there could be others who run a lot of strew node, therefore it must activate and everybody should run this node. So that would be absurd. So it's clear that there is a limit to this game theory. You can always think of some soft work and some small community that will just say this and just completely fail. So we come back to you have to estimate how big and how powerful this thing is. And I don't even know what the metric is. Yes. But also how harmful the upgrade is, because I would say that's sort of the answer to your point there, that if the upgrade itself is considered valuable, then there's very little cost for people to just switch to the other chain, the chain that can't be reorganized and that has to upgrade. That's valuable. It's a pretty good reason to actually switch while switching to a chain, even if it can't be reorc that screws with the coin limit or that kind of stuff. That's much bigger disincentive. Also a bigger disincentive for miners to switch. But some people might say that maybe a smaller coin, so smaller block size is safer. Well, they are free to fork off. That's also possible. It is possible even we didn't even discuss that. But it is possible that the change planet is lasting, that it will just forever be a lot is true minority chain and a lot is false majority chain that's now we have like the Bitcoin Bitcoin crash split or something like that. We have two coins with the big. Scary sort of Democrats hanging above it. Yeah. Unless maybe a checkpoint would have to be included in the majority chain, which would be very ugly. You could come up with some sort of incompatible software to prevent a rework in the future. Okay, sure. Let's work towards the end of this episode. Yeah. I think we've covered a lot of different arguments and explained ",

But the more I think about it, the argument is if you include lot is true in Bitcoin and Core, then that's practically guarantees that everything will be fine because the economic majority will almost certainly run it exchanges and most users. Because that assumes that this economic majority is quick to upgrade and not sort of ignoring things. I don't know. There might be companies that are running three or four year old notes because they have 16 different chit coins. So even that I would not assume that we know from the network in general that lots of people don't upgrade nodes and that one year is pretty short. Yes. But you can't tell from the nodes whether they're the economic majority or not. That might just be a few critical players that would do the trick here. Yes, I can't be sure. I'm not sure. I'm speculating. I'm explaining the argument. But the opposite is also true, that now that lot is to exist, some group of users will almost certainly run it. And that introduces maybe greater risks than if it was included in Core, because that would increase the chances of success for a Lot is true, basically, or the hash. But it really depends. Majority upgrading. Yeah, it really depends on who that group is, because if that group is just some random people who are not economically important, then they're experiencing the problem. Nobody else notices anything. Yes, that's true. If it's a very small group, that might be true. But the question is how small or how big does that group need to be for this to become a problem? And because they have an asymmetric, is that the correct English word? Yeah, asymmetry there asymmetry. Yeah. They have this advantage because their chain can never be reorg the way or the law is false change, so it can be reorved away. That's true. But their chain might never grow. So that's also a risk. So I don't know if it's not a strict advantage. Right. Well, I think it's definitely a strict advantage. Well, I mean, the advantage is you can't be reworked. The disadvantage is your chain might never grow. And I don't know which of those. Two is it will probably grow. Right. It depends on how big that group is again. And that's not something we can objectively measure. No. I guess that's sort of what it comes down to either effectively we can't. Right. We still don't know what really cost the segregate activation even four years afterwards. So that gives you an idea of how difficult it is to know what these forces really are. Yes. Well, so that's where we agree. I think it's very difficult to know either way. Yeah. Not even there might still be a lot of true minority or maybe even majority that might still happen. Yeah. Another interesting thought experiment then is to say, well, okay, so there's always going to be a lot of true group for any soft work. But what about a software that has no community support? What about some arbitrary group of people just decides to run their own software because they want to maybe somebody wants to shrink the coin supply, set the coin issues to zero tomorrow, or reduce the block size to 300. They could say, well, because it's a Softwork and because I run a lot of strew node, there could be others who run a lot of strew node, therefore it must activate and everybody should run this node. So that would be absurd. So it's clear that there is a limit to this game theory. You can always think of some soft work and some small community that will just say this and just completely fail. So we come back to you have to estimate how big and how powerful this thing is. And I don't even know what the metric is. Yes. But also how harmful the upgrade is, because I would say that's sort of the answer to your point there, that if the upgrade itself is considered valuable, then there's very little cost for people to just switch to the other chain, the chain that can't be reorganized and that has to upgrade. That's valuable. It's a pretty good reason to actually switch while switching to a chain, even if it can't be reorc that screws with the coin limit or that kind of stuff. That's much bigger disincentive. Also a bigger disincentive for miners to switch. But some people might say that maybe a smaller coin, so smaller block size is safer. Well, they are free to fork off. That's also possible. It is possible even we didn't even discuss that. But it is possible that the change planet is lasting, that it will just forever be a lot is true minority chain and a lot is false majority chain that's now we have like the Bitcoin Bitcoin crash split or something like that. We have two coins with the big. Scary sort of Democrats hanging above it. Yeah. Unless maybe a checkpoint would have to be included in the majority chain, which would be very ugly. You could come up with some sort of incompatible software to prevent a rework in the future. Okay, sure. Let's work towards the end of this episode. Yeah. I think we've covered a lot of different arguments and explained ",

And I'm kind of curious to see where people like, in general, my feeling is if you can put things on Taro, if it's a good idea, it will have value. If it's a bad idea, it will not have value. So obviously, if you launch shit coins on the Lightning network, it's still going to be a shit coin. And if it's something that has a use, then wonderful. But I get the sense that what this may do in the long term is we'll see the altcoin market gradually fizzle and kind of be like shat away, and then we'll see it kind of reconstitute itself on Lightning for a time until people realize that bad ideas are just bad ideas. And only if you actually need this should it be used. And also, you don't need to print money when you already have a base layer money. So I don't know. I'll go to Jess first here. Have you looked at Tarle much? Or do you have a general impression of them enabling tokens on Lightning? Is there anything you seem useful there. Are you a pro or against? How was your feeling? Honestly, I don't know much about it, but I mean, it just sounds like it's trying to make things more complicated. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And if there's the allowance of these tokens or shit coins, I mean, why are we even dealing with it? Do you think there's value in the interim having access to not like an algorithmic stable coin, but like having access to say, like a US dollar, which would obviously involve counterparty risk, but a US dollar equivalent that is not subject to say, like, bank account seizure. So, like, somebody wherever wants to get donations for a specific cause, they can't buy their whatever their provisions are they're in an adversarial environment where they can't have it, like in a bank account, but they want that kind of stable US dollar denominated value for a period of time before they buy whatever they need to get. Is there a value in that or do you think that's like a fleeting moment? I don't know. What do you feel? I guess Strike kind of solves that problem, right? Like they use the Lightning network to transact with different currencies. So why wouldn't you just use Strike instead of trying to implement something completely different? Yeah, I mean, if you have access like, I have Strike in Canada, but. I'm not suppose not everyone does. Yeah, I'm not supposed to have it and apparently I fucked up their development in the back end because I was using it in Canada and I had like it wasn't updated correctly and so I was fucking up stuff as I'm using it. Anyways. Besides the point. I mean, I don't have strike. Never mind. My understanding of Strike is that if you want the functionality of could Strike still just be not allowed in a particular jurisdiction app store versus an open source app? I don't know, like Eric or Dave if you know further, like, is there my understanding of tarot? And I watched Roast Beef's Talk on it, which Jesus Christ, like if every other podcast you listen to at like one five or two X, you need to listen to Roast Beef Talk at like .5 because that guy just goes and insane concepts that I would not like I need to slow it down and then repeat it to capture everything that he said. But I think my understanding is that you don't need to set up special channels for this. Perhaps only the person at the very end point of receiving a Lightning transaction would need to be running a client that deals with that kind of stuff, but outside of that it just uses stats regularly as liquidity. But then the only thing that needs to happen is the receiver and the sender need to agree on the exchange rate at the time of that transaction and then you receive basically a stable dollar value. It effectively, I think, gives people access to what would be the equivalent of the counterparty risk of having a bank account in a non adversarial environment where you could have your bank account shut down. I'm inclined to think maybe there's especially like in parts of the world where it's really fucked. Or like Canada two months ago, I could have seen some value in that. But yeah, I am inherently a little skeptical of it just because I know the baggage that's going to come along with that and I hope it doesn't bog down the Lightning network to the point where it becomes an issue. I don't know. Dave, do you have thoughts on it? Yeah, I'm not super well ",

      "text": "Hoodie thank you for joining me today. We've got lots of topics to go through. I've been following you on Twitter for a little while, and I find it takes to be really fascinating. Bitcoin takes, lightning takes, crypto takes. So let's start with your background a little bit, because your Twitter bio says you're a comedian. But I know you have some pretty sophisticated views on the crypto market that most comedians don't have. So tell me a bit more about your background and how you spend your time today. Well, first of all, thanks for having me. And I've been secretly watching some episodes of your show for a little while. I love it. I think you're, like, really focused on the specific lightning thing, and you do it like, you know, you really go down to details, and I love that. So thank you for having me on. And as for me, I got fascinated with bitcoin probably a while ago. I don't like naming years, but a good while ago and my original kind of fascination with it was because I was kind of a decentralization nerd at the time. I was really excited about how things like BitTorrent and stuff like that works. And as a software engineer, I was really attracted to how Bitcoin works in the background. I also had some basic, but still some experience with online poker at the time. Really not anything noteworthy. But the one thing that struck with me is that as an online poker player, I knew very well how difficult it was to transfer money to places that your bank or credit card company doesn't want you to transfer money to and from. And also I discovered what custody means when a lot of the online poker websites kind of uploaded, turned out to be like a big Ponzi scheme and didn't really have the funds that players thought they had. So these two concepts of censoring transactions and custody were, I think, very clear to me. Well, for most people in Western countries, didn't really have any concept of those ideas. So when I heard of Bitcoin was like, oh, that's exactly what I needed for this use case of online poker. I haven't played online poker since I've heard of Bitcoin, but at the time I was like, wow, this is exactly answers the needs of that use case. So I was fascinated by it and just how it works. And I think over the years, I became more and more interested in the kind of more economical and financial side of things as opposed to just the technical side of them. But that was definitely how I first got into it. And in the context of Lightning, even before Segwin, I think around 2016, if I remember correctly, I was involved in this research project of how we're going to take what we call back then collared coins, which is really just tokens, put them on bitcoin and then use lightning to transfer them. These days, there are at least two projects that come to mind that they're trying to do a similar thing. Tarot lightning labs and synonyms, I think, is the other one. So at least the two of those, if not others, that are trying to do the same thing. But we were looking at that back in 2016, even before Segue, even before lightning was even materially practical. So I have a long history with lightning. I was always fascinated by it. I really think it's cool. Definitely. As an engineer, I like the way that it works. It's an interesting thing to think about. But of course, recently, in the last year or two, I think I've been known more and more with my interest in non bitcoin crypto things, and I think a lot of people don't particularly like that. And my view on lightning also kind of changed. Well, I mean, I still think that it's a fascinating project, but I kind of can't ignore the fact that it didn't develop as fast as I think a lot of us were expecting earlier on, which there are a lot of reasons to that. Like I mentioned, the Sigwa thing before Segway was activated, there wasn't really much you could do. We could talk about it, we could explore the ideas of it, but couldn't really build it. And then only really in 2018, I think that development really kicked off. And in the last year there was a lot of growth, but I think it was a lot compared to other parts of the crypto market. I think the growth just wasn't as fast as some of us expected, probably. So that's kind of something that I like thinking about. Yeah, I think that's a good background. Yeah, that's ",

      "text": "now, I want to get into your work at Lightning Labs, and I want to give people an understanding of what Lightning Labs is. And maybe the place we should start off at is what is the difference between Lightning Labs and LND? Because I think there's a lot of confusion, especially among people who are not necessarily super familiar with Lightning and the Lightning network. The difference between Lightning Labs, the company, and L and D, the implementation? Yeah, absolutely. So L and D is an open source project. It's an open source Lightning implementation. It allows for people to plug into the Lightning network and Lightning Labs as a company maintains and coordinates contributions and releases for LNG, but also works on other products and services to help make building on Lightning easier. So LNG is one thing that we play a role in, but it's ultimately an open source project and something that there are external contributors to and the like. I think as you look at the open source world over the past 30 years or whatever, there are many different models for how to build and maintain a truly open source project. And especially in the last ten years, it's kind of been a Renaissance for open source with different things that have come about, different business models around building on open source. And so I think we have other products and services that we use and that we build, and those are all designed to help onboard more builders into Lightning and L. And is one of those things. It's an open source implementation of Lightning. Right? Okay. So now when you're thinking about designing products, you got a few different products out today, loop and pool, and you have Tarot that is on the horizon. How do you think about the compatibility of those products with other implementations? Because now I think we're at a stage where we've got I want to say there's four, maybe there's five kind of Lightning implementations that people recognize. There may be more smaller ones, but we have LMD. We have Core Lightning, there's Async's team with Eclair, there's LDK. How do you think about the compatibility of the products that Lightning Labs builds with those other implementations? Yeah, absolutely. It's a great question. I think there's no reason that our Liquidity products or other products that we put out there like LNC or else that could not be compatible with other implementations. But I think these things don't necessarily have to be included in other implementations. I think there's this base foundational layer spec layer for Lightning implementations where we want to have that interoperability between the implementations. But on top of that, other implementations may have other solutions to problems that our products are trying to solve, and that's kind of the beauty of a free and open market. I don't think these things necessarily need to be included at the spec layer such that everyone is required to implement them because different implementations may have different focuses or different audiences that they're working on. And so Async, for example, has done a ton of work optimizing sort of the mobile experience, which is more like the app layer than the protocol layer necessarily. And I think other implementations may have not implemented some of the work there because Async is the one that's running a mobile wallet. They have the expertise and the interest in bringing that forward. And I think as Lightning Labs, we're focused on building LNG for our current LND users, feature LND users and sort of making it as useful as possible to those users. And we're focused on building products that make Lightning easier for those builders that make it so that developers can build on Lightning in an easy way and really deliver the use cases, the end users that they want to deliver. Right. Okay. So I want to understand this as well, because I'm not fully up to speed on all the technical details of how the different implementations work. So this is an important one, I think, for me to understand is if I am running a node on a non LND implementation and I have a certain feature that I can use on my node, and I want to be able to run that same feature on LND, how do I do that? How do I communicate that to the am I working with the Lightning Labs team? Am I working with this open source group of contributors? How do we get to basically where anyone who has a feature on their Lightning node implementation can integrate it with other implementations if both teams agree that this is an optimal outcome? It's a great question. I think it has to do a little bit with the spec process and what's associated there, and I won't pretend to be an expert on that, but I think at the spec layer, what is determined is what is necessary for Lightning node implementations to be interoperable so that everything works. And I think that is considered sort of a base layer of different things that need to happen in order for Lightning notes to be interoperable, defining invoices different components like that. Right. And then there are things that can be built on top of that. They may not be necessary for all of the different implementations to pick up and actually utilize. There may be stuff on the application layer above the sort of spec layer that it's not necessary for certain implementations to pick up and use. So, like, Ln URL is an example of something that was built on the application layer that was kind of built outside of the spec process that a lot of different apps and services and wallets are using, but isn't necessarily built into the spec process such that each Lightning implementation has to implement it. And so I think that when we think about the different features of different implementations and different things like that, we want to encourage building, we want to encourage growth, and we want there to be this layer where you can kind of build stuff that doesn't necessarily need to be a part of each and every implementation because it's kind of on the app layer, it allows for more experimentation, different things like that. Whereas the spec process, the bulk process is focused on what do we need to do in order for the Lightning network to be interoperable, for node implementations to work together? And that's sort of a thin layer of requirements and of specs that all the implementations have to follow. Okay, I see that makes a lot more sense. So there's going to be like a Bolt Essential layer that everyone needs in order to communicate back and forth. And then you're saying you think people are going to be experimenting more on the app layer above that where it doesn't depend on individual node implementation. It's something that kind of lives outside of that spec process. And there's a process that recently got started called Lips, which allows for app developers to put a standard together or like a proposal together for a standard that lives on the app layer outside of the bold process, so to speak. So this it encourages people to build and experiment and do different things on top of that spec implementation layer without having to go through the full process of putting something through the spec because you want all implementations to use it, because it should be part of sort of interoperability standards, and that different stuff. Okay. So when we think about something like a Lightning Lapse Pool product, is that on the app layer then? Because I think right now that's I believe only compatible with LNG nodes. Is that correct? Yes. Is that in the spec process, or is that on the app layer? Yeah. I mean, I think that that's on the app layer. It's something where other implementations could integrate with Pool, but it's something where we don't necessarily believe that we need to dictate the way that liquidity management happens at the protocol layer. It's something where we think, like experimentation and different use cases, different things happening, rapid innovation, rapid iteration around helping people do the liquidity management component of Lightning, can live at that app layer, can live at that layer above the protocol specification. Okay, let's just do a full rundown of the products that Lightning Labs is working on right now. I want to make sure I get everything so we have Loop. I believe that was one of the first products you guys launched. There's Pool Terminal and Tarot upcoming. Can you talk about how these products kind of fit into the overall vision of Lightning Labs? Like, I'm trying to understand what you guys are building towards when you design these different products. It's a great question. I think part of the reason why I love working in Lightning Labs is because the vision and the mission is so clear and our products fit nicely into it. And I think the mission is to bring Bitcoin to billions of people leveraging the Lightning network. Right. And we want to do so by using the vision and execution of builders, developers, entrepreneurs who can make these useful products on Lightning. They can reach these audiences who need a problem solved, and they can use Lightning to do so. Everything that we work on is kind of basically to either make Lightning easier to build on or to make it possible for those builders to reach even more end users. Right. So something like Loop and Pool, in my opinion, basically makes it easier to build on Lightning. It provides these useful services and products to help builders manage their liquidity so that they can have an operational nodes that they can receive payments source inbound all of that different stuff. Whereas something like Taro unlocks a whole new set of use cases that builders can leverage to reach even more end users with these useful products and services. And so everything that we're working on is with this mission and vision in mind of reaching billions of people with Bitcoin. And we work on products that make it easier to build on Lightning or make it possible for you to reach more end users with Lightning. And so when you think about each of these individual products, are there any network effects at play here, like, where one product can then benefit the other and benefit the other and benefit the other? Any cross product synergies or ways that these products can kind of work together? Yeah. I mean, when I think about Terminal, for instance, I think that there's a real benefit to having an easy to use UX for products like Loop and Pool. Right. And so I think building that UX layer, building it such that it's really easy to get connected with your node to this web experience. It makes it easy to sort of understand and manage liquidity on the Lightning network through Loop. And Pool is the type of thing where we see cross product synergies in terms of delivering that experience to end users. So that's one example of that. I think there are many more that we can go into. Okay. ",

          "text": "now, I want to get into your work at Lightning Labs, and I want to give people an understanding of what Lightning Labs is. And maybe the place we should start off at is what is the difference between Lightning Labs and LND? Because I think there's a lot of confusion, especially among people who are not necessarily super familiar with Lightning and the Lightning network. The difference between Lightning Labs, the company, and L and D, the implementation? Yeah, absolutely. So L and D is an open source project. It's an open source Lightning implementation. It allows for people to plug into the Lightning network and Lightning Labs as a company maintains and coordinates contributions and releases for LNG, but also works on other products and services to help make building on Lightning easier. So LNG is one thing that we play a role in, but it's ultimately an open source project and something that there are external contributors to and the like. I think as you look at the open source world over the past 30 years or whatever, there are many different models for how to build and maintain a truly open source project. And especially in the last ten years, it's kind of been a Renaissance for open source with different things that have come about, different business models around building on open source. And so I think we have other products and services that we use and that we build, and those are all designed to help onboard more builders into Lightning and L. And is one of those things. It's an open source implementation of Lightning. Right? Okay. So now when you're thinking about designing products, you got a few different products out today, loop and pool, and you have Tarot that is on the horizon. How do you think about the compatibility of those products with other implementations? Because now I think we're at a stage where we've got I want to say there's four, maybe there's five kind of Lightning implementations that people recognize. There may be more smaller ones, but we have LMD. We have Core Lightning, there's Async's team with Eclair, there's LDK. How do you think about the compatibility of the products that Lightning Labs builds with those other implementations? Yeah, absolutely. It's a great question. I think there's no reason that our Liquidity products or other products that we put out there like LNC or else that could not be compatible with other implementations. But I think these things don't necessarily have to be included in other implementations. I think there's this base foundational layer spec layer for Lightning implementations where we want to have that interoperability between the implementations. But on top of that, other implementations may have other solutions to problems that our products are trying to solve, and that's kind of the beauty of a free and open market. I don't think these things necessarily need to be included at the spec layer such that everyone is required to implement them because different implementations may have different focuses or different audiences that they're working on. And so Async, for example, has done a ton of work optimizing sort of the mobile experience, which is more like the app layer than the protocol layer necessarily. And I think other implementations may have not implemented some of the work there because Async is the one that's running a mobile wallet. They have the expertise and the interest in bringing that forward. And I think as Lightning Labs, we're focused on building LNG for our current LND users, feature LND users and sort of making it as useful as possible to those users. And we're focused on building products that make Lightning easier for those builders that make it so that developers can build on Lightning in an easy way and really deliver the use cases, the end users that they want to deliver. Right. Okay. So I want to understand this as well, because I'm not fully up to speed on all the technical details of how the different implementations work.

      "text": "Yeah, let's go into it. First up, let's start with Pool. Sorry. Let's start with Loop. Who was Loop built for? Like, what was the target audience in mind when the product first came out? Yeah, absolutely. So let's start with Loop is Loop is a service that makes it easier to send and receive funds on Lightning. It basically serves as an on off ramp or bridge between the Bitcoin Lightning network and the Bitcoin blockchain. Right. And so as we saw the network and the number of Lightning applications grow, we heard and I wasn't here at the time Loop was launched, but I know kind of the backstory we heard from users that there was a lot of interest in a solution to help them manage liquidity and help them move funds between on chain and off chain. And so Lightning channels are like tubes of money or abacuses. The more you spend, the more you can receive and different things like that. And I think as the money moves around, there are challenges associated with that. Liquidity needs to be in the right place at the right time in order for you to either receive or send payments. Right. And so I think who Lightning is built for is these merchants and these businesses that are building on top of Lightning. Let's take an example to kind of walk through it so if I'm a merchant and I'm selling T shirts on the Lightning network, right, I open up some channels, but I only have outbound liquidity at that point so I can't actually receive payments. So I can use loop to loop out some of that outbound liquidity, which gives me inbound liquidity and moves funds to my own chain wallet. And it creates that inbound liquidity for my business so that I can then receive payments. Let's say my business is doing really well. I'm receiving a lot of payments. I sell a bunch of T shirts, but then I run out of inbound liquidity. Right. I can no longer receive payments via Lightning because I'm out of that inbound liquidity. And I may not even know about this if I'm not looking at my note managing my node actively. But to get back that inbound liquidity, one thing you can do is loop out. Again, you move funds on chain, you replenish that inbound liquidity. And with those on chain funds, you can sell it to get Fiat to cover cost of goods or other expenses associated with your business, while at the same time you add that inbound back in, you allow for people to again pay for stuff and buy stuff through your business. Got it. So primarily this is targeting businesses. Do you think there's also what's the market for routing nodes to be using something like loop? Is that going to be a big component as well? I think we do see routing nodes using loop to a certain extent. I think that one thing that they do is point liquidity in the direction of a loop in order to route towards it because loop is a sync in the traditional sense of pulling stats towards it, and so they can earn fees against that. And then you will see routing and operators occasionally loop out or loop in to sort of move liquidity around within their channels. As a routing and operator, you're really cognizant of the fact that liquidity needs to be in the right place at the right time in order for you to route payments, in order for you to earn fees and actually run a profitable routing note. Okay, that makes sense. So now that's loop, that was the first product. What did you guys learn? What lessons did Lightning Labs learn? I know this may have been before you arrived to Lightning Labs, but were there any lessons there that you then took to pool and now are taking to Tarot and other products in the future? Yes. As I mentioned, I've only been at Landing Lounge for a year now. I can't speak to necessarily the explicit lessons, but I know the team and I know what we always think about and learn from our products is how do we build a feedback loop with users so that we can improve based on their needs? We're always constantly asking users, what do you need? How can we make this better. What can we do for you? And so every product that we build at Lightning Love stems from that mission, which is to bring Bitcoin to billions of users. In order to do that, we need builders to be building products and services that are reaching end users, providing useful services to them. And so we talked to these builders about building on Lightning, trying to solve their problems. And that's what happened with Loop. You talk to builders about how Loop is meeting their needs, about what other features they may want, and you try to iterate and build against those needs and sort of prioritize based on what the user needs are. I hope you're enjoying the show so far. I just want to give a quick shout out to our sponsor, Voltage. Voltage is the industry standard for lightning network infrastructure. Creating layer two applications and services on top of Bitcoin starts with Voltage, where you can spin up nodes, get access to liquidity, optimize your node, and much more.

      "text": "when. You understand kind of what founders are doing right now. Talk to me about trends that you're seeing. Obviously, across early stage startups and even growth stage startups, we've seen valuations come down quite a bit. We've seen funding dry up a little bit for technology startups right now. A lot of that's macro market and kind of macro economy driven, obviously, in the bitcoin ecosystem, bitcoin itself has drawn down. What are you seeing from funding trends right now for founders building a bitcoin? Okay, so pump. This is interesting. Here's what we're seeing. So we know that in a bear market and a crypto bear market, there's a flight to security and safety. And at the same time, there's this pressure on BTC as the most liquid asset, right? So we have the price of BTC under pressure as folks liquidate BTC to cover debt. But on the flip side, there's an acknowledgement of bitcoin as a more mature technology, the more secure technology, and the one that's sort of proven itself historically and most likely to continue for the duration. And so in the venture capital world, actually, what we've seen is two things. So first, we haven't seen a markdown in valuations because, frankly, bitcoin companies are already traded at a discount, right? A discount to their crypto peers, because we don't have these really hot competitive rounds driven by multiple multibillion dollar funds that are competing for limited space. This is something maybe we can dig into later or in another episode. But the other thing we're seeing, in addition to that stability, is that we're seeing generalist VCs want to pay more attention to the bitcoin side. So since news of the recession hit in the past six to eight weeks, I've been fielding inbound calls for more information about some of our portfolio companies. So I probably shouldn't say more than that, but I think that in a bear market, the things that glitter and shine or that are marketed really well become less appealing. And people really want to go for the tech that has been built robustly, and that's bitcoin. So there's an opportunity here for bitcoin founders. And what can I flip the question to you. What do you think? Of course, I think that I see a lot of founders who, as things went up, kind of got high on their own supply a little bit. And this is not just bitcoin. This is like across the entire market. And naturally, if you've got high on your own supply and you think that your company is amazing and all these things, it's really hard to then search around and be like, hey, I got to be really critical about my business, right? The market has changed, and so this stuff changes. The good news is that I think we're now at a point over the last six weeks that founders have kind of come to that realization. And I would say majority, if not all of them, are like, okay, things have changed. I need to change. But that's a hard process. And there's a lot of investors that I've spoken to, they're like, man, we might have been thinking about this three months ago, and it took a while to kind of get founders to see it as well. And I wish it would have happened earlier. Can't go back and change the past, but I think we're now at a point where it's very obvious that the market has changed. Another thing that I've started to see is I'm starting to see the early signs, not a ton, but enough, where I think it's going to become a trend. Many technical folks, engineers and people kind of involved in the development process at larger companies starting to leave under the premise of, I'm thinking about building a company. And so naturally, in bad times, people start saying to themselves, well, maybe I should just kind of go out on my own. And so if we're already seeing that somewhat early in this, my guess is the next six months we're going to see a ton of technical talent kind of shuffle around, and a number of them will start companies that end up being funded and kind of become the next crop of companies over the next two to three years. Yeah, we're seeing that too. In addition to people leaving big shops, we're also seeing people excuse me, to start their own thing. We're also seeing them do that to join teams. And so it doesn't feel like there's any halting of progression, and in fact, it feels the opposite. And I think that's due to what we talked about last time, which is the tailwind that Bitcoin and tech innovation in general can appreciate now from the development of Lightning Network and the soon to be introduction of Tarot, it's catalytic to people's imagination. So when people turn inward and reflect on what they're doing during a recession or in a bear market, the things that matter are the meaning of your work, not just how fast you're building or how much money you're making. And so the meaning of your work is, I think, always really clear on the bitcoin side. And so I'm hopeful for that. I think that a bear market is not only a time to build, but also a time that signal becomes clearer. And of course, that's always what we're looking for. So I anticipate bear markets with excitement because of those things. ",

          "text": "when. You understand kind of what founders are doing right now. Talk to me about trends that you're seeing. Obviously, across early stage startups and even growth stage startups, we've seen valuations come down quite a bit. We've seen funding dry up a little bit for technology startups right now. A lot of that's macro market and kind of macro economy driven, obviously, in the bitcoin ecosystem, bitcoin itself has drawn down. What are you seeing from funding trends right now for founders building a bitcoin? Okay, so pump. This is interesting. Here's what we're seeing. So we know that in a bear market and a crypto bear market, there's a flight to security and safety. And at the same time, there's this pressure on BTC as the most liquid asset, right? So we have the price of BTC under pressure as folks liquidate BTC to cover debt. But on the flip side, there's an acknowledgement of bitcoin as a more mature technology, the more secure technology, and the one that's sort of proven itself historically and most likely to continue for the duration. And so in the venture capital world, actually, what we've seen is two things. So first, we haven't seen a markdown in valuations because, frankly, bitcoin companies are already traded at a discount, right? A discount to their crypto peers, because we don't have these really hot competitive rounds driven by multiple multibillion dollar funds that are competing for limited space. This is something maybe we can dig into later or in another episode. But the other thing we're seeing, in addition to that stability, is that we're seeing generalist VCs want to pay more attention to the bitcoin side.

      "text": "that's. I think what you're saying and that's sort of like the most charitable interpretation. But I was around at the time and I was reading everything and watching everything. It wasn't played out that way. It was mostly most of that market was just waiting on bated breath to see what Vitalik would say. And based on what the Italik wrote, it wasn't clear which way he was going to go, whether he was going to preserve the code as law principle or not. And I still remember, like watching a video of a guy explaining, okay, well, if the Talek says this, then I'm going to support him. If he says the exact opposite, I'm also going to support him. And it very much became sort of like this. Everyone is looking to Vitalek to figure out how they should feel kind of thing. It was a very weird kind of like mentality to me, which was like, okay, well, you don't have an opinion. You're only just sort of like they almost felt like sports fans. It's like whatever my team does, it was the right thing to do. If they released the player, that guy was a bum. If they kept him, he's going to be a superstar. That's how it felt to me when I remember watching it. So the conceptual sort of desire and the actual reality on the ground of what actually happened, I think you can argue we're pretty different. And how it actually played out essentially was very much like a dictatorial, benevolent dictator kind of thing. For that particular incident, at least, I. Think there was a lot of naivety at the time. Right. I think that again, trying to use empathy here. I do think that people felt restricted by what was happening with Bitcoin. Something was going to come out of that. What came out of that was Ethereum. And I think that I think that still pervades the theorem today, as I still think they like to conceive of what they're doing is something that is not Bitcoin. I still don't agree with that. I prefer to look at Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. My preferred lens would be to look at Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market at largest competing financial systems and almost to divide them there. And to say that, okay, in one of these financial systems, you have a clear list of very strong rights to your financial property, or even just property. If you want to let it down to that, as Michael Sailor and Nick Carter do, they'll make the argument that Bitcoin enters property rights. And I think that's totally fair. And then I think you can look at the cryptocurrency industry. And again, if you look at the large mass of cryptocurrencies, again, they seem to behave in common ways and they have common attitudes. So I think it's sort of about finding what those are. And I think the more that I can figure it out, they seem okay with letting the market decisions. I agree in your specific case that at the time it did feel like decisions were being made by small groups of people. I mean, certainly people were very deferential to the developers and the meritocracy amongst the developers. In terms of listening to those folks, you could argue the same thing happened in Bitcoin, right, when Bitcoin faced its own existential questions. I mean, certainly there are people within the meritocracy of Bitcoin were more vocal and you kind of face it. And I've spent a lot of time grappling with this question, as well as what happened with Bitcoin and how it's already been exerted in the space. But I think ultimately Bitcoin became a system where dissent was allowed. If you actually really want to give a lot of credit to the developers, I would spend less time talking with the cryptocurrency developers because I don't think they made the right sequence of choices. I think the more impressive set of choices was made by the Bitcoin developers, who I think at many times could have just made their problems a lot easier by choosing the weaker path of just enacting some popular decision or some popular fork. And they were very early on, I think, to recognize this idea that like Adam Back was very early in this as well. He made this argument, I think during the early periods of the fork wars that Bitcoin was apolitical money. Right. This idea that we don't want decisions being made in which majorities can form and majorities can rescind the rights of other users. There's the famous kind of picture of Adam back at the Hong Kong meeting with the Bitcoin miners where he's talking about the problems with democracy. I think Adam was always pretty uniquely conscious of this problem where if Bitcoin was not a system where you couldn't have freedom from the majority, then Bitcoin wasn't a unique thing. And I think the fact that they were able to preserve that when so much pressure was on them to overturn that, I think we should do more to talk about that. Right. I think the right to dissent within Bitcoin is something that not a lot of people have actually even practiced. The fact that we had SegWit and not everybody used it. We'll have Taproot and not everybody will use it. And ultimately that Bitcoin is a system where you can still have your Mercier peskies who continue running Satoshi's original client, they continue to descend. I think that Right to dissent is foundational to Bitcoin. I think it makes Bitcoin something else. And I think in systems where there is no right to dissent. And again, I actually even really want to pause there for a second because I really want to spend more time thinking about that word, dissent. I actually don't know if it's the right word. I think you have to start asking about what is dissent, right. We even have that in democracies. Are you allowed to dissent? What does that even mean, I think what that means is that within Bitcoin, as long as you agree to the consensus of the 21 million Bitcoins, as long as you agree that this 21 million supply of Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and that everyone who the Ledger says has Bitcoin owns Bitcoin, that from there you can chart your own course. Right. You as an individual can be free from coercion, and then you can make choice, you can opt in to the structures that you want. So Bitcoin becomes a financial system that starts to feel a lot more defined by consent, whereas past political systems and financial systems were defined by force. And I think even if you split them that way, where the cryptocurrency ecosystem is an ecosystem where decisions are made by force and political collusion and political alignment, and that it continues those aspects of the Fiat system, whereas Bitcoin is a system of financial system entirely by consent, I think you start building what's powerful about Bitcoin and you start talking about the things that I think we actually know about Bitcoin, but are harder to put our finger on because they seem a little bit more cohesive. So I've sort of over the last day and a half been thinking about Bitcoin as a financial system of consent. Like, what does that mean? And if other cryptocurrencies are not that, then I think it seems to start feeling a lot easier to just call them something else. And maybe to argue that they are not equal financial systems to Bitcoin, that they are somehow worse for certain reasons. Certainly, I think you could make that argument. Well. So I think what you're saying is that it's not so much the right to dissent, it's freedom from coercion by the majority, something like that. That is very much part of all coins where you can be coerced by the majority. For example, in a hard fork where you can't do the things that were available before the hard fork anymore, would you say that's maybe a way to look at what you're kind of trying to say? Yeah, I think so. I think that what I'm trying to say is that in Bitcoin, majorities can form and majorities can take actions. The majority can't make you, the individual, do something. Right. I think that's what's trying to be expressed. And I think to rely on historical examples again, I think there's communities within Bitcoin that resisted changes very strongly. And ultimately the core developers sort of had to make a decision. Right. The core developers, I think, really had to look at the situation and say, like, well, if we choose to invalidate someone right to Bitcoin, then we are telling people what Bitcoin is. And if we decide what Bitcoin is, does Bitcoin exist? And I think the Bitcoin developers made the more elegant decision. I think Bitcoin is defined by the individual and their ability or their right to that Bitcoin. Right. And I think that the fact that that is irrevocable within Bitcoin, that there's nothing that can happen within Bitcoin for you to be disenfranchised. If that is the bedrock of the Bitcoin financial system, you can clearly state that that's not the bedrock of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The cryptocurrency ecosystem, again, seems to appear to be a system in which you are constantly sort of your money is at risk from some majority, and if, in any case, you end up in the minority, you will have to bear some financial cost to continue on your own. I think, again, how morality gets defined in that environment, to me, becomes a lot more hard because you're sort of saying, okay, it's okay. Just imagine the individual navigating that landscape even as you're sort of defining it. Like you're sort of imagining this individual who has money and you're constantly sort of at risk to some political force. Right. That seems like the system we were trying to escape with Bitcoin. Right. So I think I've become a lot more sympathetic to this idea that the reason that we chose the path of soft Forks is because it was harder and it was harder because you can't force people to go along with you. You have to build coalitions peacefully. You have to enact change without force. And ultimately the end of the day, if nobody wants to use tap room, you can't make them. They can continue enjoying their rights the same way they would if you never did. That right. I think a lot of developers found that very frustrating. It's easy to see why developers would want to leave that type of system. And maybe we'll find when the history books are written that they did right, and that they did largely choose to join some other system. And the results of that were they continue to build other systems that were weaker towards human rights and maybe there'll be problems there. I can't write the end of that story. All I can do is sort of say, as someone who's been here eight years, I'm increasingly sort of troubled by it and think that it seems like it's going in a weird direction. ",

All I can do is sort of say, as someone who's been here eight years, I'm increasingly sort of troubled by it and think that it seems like it's going in a weird direction. ",

      "text": "I'm also curious as well. I know there's been more work around anchor output channels and that's actually in the new version zero three of LNG, that's becoming the default for Node to both support anchor output channels. And so does that help with the fee with that transaction pinning problem or is there an interaction there or not at all? Yeah. So it helps because there's something that added. I think Matt kind of led it to basically add what's like an exception in some Edge case that kind of led some of the pending behavior in the Quincy itself. The idea is, I always say, okay, well, you can kind of have this one more output basically. And because the other party doesn't really control that output, I can then use that as Cpfp thing to get back into the chain. It's definitely helpful in that domain. I think another thing that we kind of realized over time is that like option RBF was added to kind of like placate certain companies at the time that they really want to deal with things like Coinbase or for us, I think we're realizing as well that okay, it has some words. Maybe we need to go to full RVF. The difference is like an opting basically apps like Signal on. Okay, well, this is replaceable full RBA anyway. I think the thing anyway is that I feel like this stuff is very fuzzy at times because once again, it depends on what the miners are running. Right. They could be running full Rpm and if they are, then that's fine. And it's a lot simpler as well too, because you don't really know exactly what the relay that was running or what my age running as well too. It's kind of a thing where it is still super fuzzy. So that's why I think people talk about these attacks as well too. Things like that. But it just seems like at times like they have like a Goldilocks model. Okay. Well the fee is just like low enough where it's not getting dropped from the memory but it's not high enough to be confirmed. Things like that as well too. So I think in practice probably a lot more difficult to pull off than some people feel like it is. At the same time because it's there. We should definitely address these factors to make sure we're making sure that things are as entertain as they can be secured. Got it? Yeah. So with Taproot coming, I'm curious as well your thoughts on whether there is potential to use something like music too as part of Lightning network and the way Lightning nodes talk to each other, is that something you're looking at? What's the thought there? Yeah definitely generally compressing down a lot too. I think the one thing people will be like as well too right now once again people are generally like public stats about the network by kind of looking at what are kind of PQAs eight outputs type thing. Most things. Cool thing about this is like this basically lets any transaction look any good. Jackson also blend in, right. So Lightning channel could look at numbers in action as well too. Things are cool in the context of things like pool where it's okay. Well people kind of like have these accounts or accounts like that as well too. That makes you just look like one big multi multi operation. I think there's a lot to increase and enhance Privacy of individuals. I think the other cool thing is once again go back to some of those things that we talked about as far as this process because you can basically encode different possibilities in the top routine and not really have to commit to that itself. That kind of really opens up the design space. What can we really be doing in general? So another cool thing that it allows something people talked about in the past, this thing called like a PTLC which rather like using a payment has a hash function for the actual payment Identifier using discrete log based security primitives like signatures etc. Stuff as well to really build the design space then you add DLC on top of that as well too. But then it's a thing where it's like I feel like design space is basically just so large once you add like that itself and it gets even larger as well too. So I think one thing we work on the background, I think Russia is a people have like this where you're doing as well basically the ability to update a channel on the fly. Right. So one thing is like right now someone is basically upgraded to a tabloid channel. They have to actually close the channel on chain and open another one. Obviously that's not good because we have over 40,000 channels right now. Once again, like you're saying it's going to take several months but to do that, right? So instead of wage basically let's say I have like a normal segment channel output itself. Then like you and I chain, basically we spend that transaction, right? Then we have a new transaction, then it creates a tap or output, right. And then we actually just keep that off chain and we never need to post that unless we actually need to force close. The thing is it's actually the same thing because otherwise you just need to close and then open. And in this case maybe I have an extra jacket whenever I need to close. So once again is a really cool thing in theory. Come I can update the entire network on the fly to these new versions without doing any on transactions at all. Right. As more and more things come up. So people are doing DLCs multi off setting. They're doing other kind of like more elaborate on things like that as well too. So it should be the case where as long as you have this multi state type contract of the channel, you can then upgrade that on the fly as if you download a new application on your phone. Definitely we can get to have things really important as well too because obviously we want to be able to incorporate the latest and greatest to give the users. But basically having users auto chain. Because one thing is once you get enlightening, basically you never want to close that channel. You kind of like oh I pay on chains. The only thing we can do basically I can do to kind of control interactions or modifying parameters like that. Things definitely like a big thing going forward. And yeah, I guess that's the only thing we've yet to really get together and make a big push to do all the designs for post separate lighting. Definitely much like mailing those posts from people like AJ and other people game planning. What can we do over here and things like that? I think it's the case where it's like it's the thing where we probably need to have something very simple to begin with and then go from there because otherwise maybe it's going to get really bogged down in terms of trying to do everything all at once. I think the other thing is if the world is opening up a little bit more now, definitely we really have to basically get back in person with developers. I think there's a very high bandwidth. We talk about things as well too. We had one in Australia and Adelaide, Russia's name two years ago and that itself was foundation for everything we're doing right now itself. So even like one meeting over the course of a few years was super important. We're looking forward to basically speaking with people in person again and getting back getting me space going. Just because once you're back my conference, talk to my developers. Okay. This is kind of cool. This is why the team interactions. Yeah, that'll be great to see. So another thing I was interested to chat about is this whole idea of spontaneous payments. And I know that's something coming up in the new LNG. So I guess this has gone through all sorts of different iterations, right. Because in the past, people have used they've had to make a new invoice to receive donations or just to receive money. There was key sent and now we've got this spontaneous payments ID. So can you tell us a little bit about that? What is that? Yes. Question. So typically the way payments work in lightning, say you kind of like have an invoice and you have a payment hash, right. Like an ACLC. You kind of like extend this thing in kind of like an incremental manner. Like just like the whole routing basically until the destination, then the destination reveals a pre emerge and then goes away backwards and boom, payments are fulfilled. Right. So pushing this container works a little bit differently because instead, rather than the receiver generating that secret value, I generate it myself. I didn't encrypt it in the onion payload of the actual payment. I'm sending it to you itself. It gets all the way to you, then you decrypt it and settle that yourself. And that's kind of like the initial key set version. Right. So basically, initially we did that it was meant to be a little bit more temporary, but some things like Amp will be longer than expected, but then Amp builds on top of that. So, you know, like there's something called MPP payments basically let you kind of split into several different charge based on the individual. So Amp does that forbid for key set. Right. So I was sudden. Now you can then kind of do that same thing. I can push you a payment when we publish key and then payment up in general. This is really cool because now this lets you do things like kind of like spontaneous tipping. Maybe you have a subset type of thing where you have like a podcasting or whatever else people really like as well too. And it's also kind of like the foundation of things like things that do push payment. If you have a message from the podcast next time as well, too. Definitely something pretty excited about. Definitely. It took a little bit to realize and software. We definitely learned a lot along the way. We don't have a bunch of other cool things coming up as well, too. One other thing lets you also kind of like we use invoice more like you would like no more common address at the time. We have issues as far as maybe it's Dale or any payroll. I can just kind of have one side Identifier and then do that more directly. Right. There are things like Ellen URL and offers other kind you do that. The differences with that, those are so interactive. And I basically used to fetch invoice for you every single time. Right. So it is nice to basically have one and done type of thing. But imagine in the future, let's say I'm renting a scooter and have a QR code and I do an amp payment to that. Boom, there. That can work. Just kind of an example. I can press it down the steps a little bit more. That is really cool. One of the other things that people charge with that, for example, lightning missing, lets you attach arbitrary key value pairs in a given message, kind of like metadata. Right. So in the future I could say, okay, well, I'm tipping you on Twitter and I ask like, hey, thanks for the podcast. I like little messages there. Right. You didn't see much of the other side as well, too. That message once again, like fully encrypted into an individual. Because unless you do a lot of experimentation as far as what can you do? What kind of cool things like adding like a small line metadata in the protocol to particular payment, which I think is a cool thing. Right. Yeah. So this is going to be very handy for people who are online and they want to have just a static QR, so they can start taking donations with this kind of thing where I guess historically they would have had to set up, say, a BTC Pay server, which might be ",

Alice Alice's Adventures in Wonderland on why she passed on terror related investment opportunities. Other aspects of the Luna UST setup in foresight were even worse than the inadequate 19.5% anchor yield. For example, investors needed to first buy Luna to subsequently mint UST. And only then could they deposit the UST in anchor. In this process, some Luna is burnt I e. Supply decreased, putting upward pressure on Luna's price and temporarily masking the fundamental insolvency of the system. As long as Luna's price went up and UST's yield was being paid anchor and the entire ecosystem appeared to be working, luna's hyperinflationary spiral hadn't yet been triggered, and there was no difficulty maintaining the UST peg. There is a nuanced circularity to this process. Luna's price rise sent a false signal that all is well, which, combined with anchors 19 5% yield, attracted more and more capital into the system, further strengthening Luna's floor price through its burning process. Rinse, wash, repeat the reverse of that process. A socalled death spiral was inevitable anytime the Immeasurably over levered global fiat monetary system, for whatever reason, experience one of its periodic external shocks that skyrocket's immediate demand for actual US dollar liquidity. UST. Investors would demand USD liquidity faster than the brittle and fundamentally flawed Terra ecosystem could provide. At some point, one USD would be worth materially less than one USD, further rattling investors and kicking off a classic bank run. Worse, with algorithmic certainty, the UST. Bank run would be accelerated by a corresponding hyperinflation in Luna. This is exactly what happened. Just as the global capital market shocks of March and April 2020 drove sudden insatiable demand for US dollar liquidity, the shocks of April and May 2022 did as well. As the most levered risk assets crashed. USD liquidity demand skyrocketed. Andrea's systemic weaknesses were revealed. UST collapsed from one dollar to five cents, while Luna collapsed from a high of $116 to zero. And it's gone. Quote what do you mean you're going to pass? The only people making money passing are NFL quarterbacks, and I don't see a number on your back. Seth Davis Boiler pitching Luna on Twitter several sophisticated financial institutions profited enormously from this penny stock like pump and dump with old school boiler room promotional phone calls to unsuspecting retail buyers placed by look how cool I Am Twitter brags from the principles of the institutions propelling the pump. The institutions, of course, sold before the dump. Sadly, on behalf of Terra's retail believers, the wisdom of PT. Barnum has aged well. Sadly, on behalf of Terra's institutional exploiters the teachings of the Golden Rule have not. The common theme among the nine figure fortune makers was expert grounding in macro trading and deeper knowledge of currency pegs than their average Twitter disciple. Even the peg blowing hedge funds in 1992 for the British pound in 1997. The tie bot didn't pump the currencies of the pegs, they destroyed. A critique of the many current critiques of the UST luna debacle is that they merely represent after the fact, I told you so. Piling on that's false well in advance. Many commentators, including the authors, shared UST luna warnings via Twitter, blogs, private emails, and the masterpiece Only the Strong Survive, notably published in September 2021, which from first principles powerfully and presciently warned of forthcoming D Five blow ups. In the harrowing words of Harry marcopolis, no one would listen. So we'll repeat again in advance, no matter how well intentioned, all algorithmic stablecoins will fail. And the vast majority, possibly all of D fifty's current versions will fail. Where fail here means not gaining sufficient critical mass to matter being hacked, blowing up, or being altered by regulation to the point of non viability. In the end, the Tarot project could control the supply of its money, but it couldn't make its people value it. A printing press was the only non answer. Sound familiar? Lacking a lender of last resort, d Five recreates the problems solved by central banks. Bitcoin solves the problems created by central banks. The future is so bright, I got to wear shades. Tim buck three on DeFi. Scratch that. LiFi okay, let's take another break right here and talk about our sponsor. Now, I know that you are stacking like crazy, just like rad Swan here. This kid stacks like crazy, and he keeps his stats on his safe and secure and easy to use hardware wallet. The BigBox too, and he is only 17 days old. Now, I actually use the bitbox for a bunch of different setups lately. It's been my daily driver for quite some time, but it's also been great for my Android phone and for a number of my multi SIG setups. Now, I've included the bitbox, and they have a mobile and desktop app, which are just really super intuitive. They're easy to use. I'm a little picky about my hardware wallets, and there are only a handful that I really love, and the bitbox really shines. A solid hardware wallet with a proper backup is literally 99% of the securing your keys process of being sovereign. If you have a meaningful amount of capital in bitcoin and you have left it on an exchange, you have got to fix that, man. It's not that hard. Hold your own keys, invest in a safe, simple hardware device. It's not that complicated. It literally takes a few minutes to set it up, make your backup you're up and running, and just withdraw your bitcoin. The bitbox two is minutes away from bitcoin sovereignty. Just go to guyswan combatbox, takes you directly to the store codeguyguy, gets you 5% off everything. So grab your bitbox vault, get yourself some security goodies, get yourself 5% off, and become bitcoinslaughter again. Guyswan combitbox. All right, let's jump back into the piece. The future is so bright, I gotta wear shades. Tim buck three on D phi. Scratch that. LiFi imagine an ecosystem in which the building blocks of financial and capital markets are freely accessible to all without navigation of technical bottlenecks or economic middlemen in which their workings are transparently. inspectable and auditable on the basis of free and open source code in which the architecture of all marketplaces operate on these principles in which this constitution lends itself naturally to programmability at origin and interoperability thereafter. And in which. Due to the combination of the aforementioned factors. No individual or entity can maliciously or politically impact market activity in any form. Including advantaging themselves or disadvantaging others. The concept of decentralized finance is powerful, noble, and worthy of a lifetime of focused effort. Such a financial system would be censorship resistant and secure with collateral that is, collateral and sustainably low transaction fees. Yield would mean yield. Deposits would mean deposits.

          "text": "It was all very well to say drink me, but I'll look first and see whether it's marked poison or not. Alice Alice's Adventures in Wonderland on why she passed on terror related investment opportunities. Other aspects of the Luna UST setup in foresight were even worse than the inadequate 19.5% anchor yield. For example, investors needed to first buy Luna to subsequently mint UST. And only then could they deposit the UST in anchor. In this process, some Luna is burnt I e. Supply decreased, putting upward pressure on Luna's price and temporarily masking the fundamental insolvency of the system. As long as Luna's price went up and UST's yield was being paid anchor and the entire ecosystem appeared to be working, luna's hyperinflationary spiral hadn't yet been triggered, and there was no difficulty maintaining the UST peg. There is a nuanced circularity to this process. Luna's price rise sent a false signal that all is well, which, combined with anchors 19 5% yield, attracted more and more capital into the system, further strengthening Luna's floor price through its burning process. Rinse, wash, repeat the reverse of that process. A socalled death spiral was inevitable anytime the Immeasurably over levered global fiat monetary system, for whatever reason, experience one of its periodic external shocks that skyrocket's immediate demand for actual US dollar liquidity. UST. Investors would demand USD liquidity faster than the brittle and fundamentally flawed Terra ecosystem could provide. At some point, one USD would be worth materially less than one USD, further rattling investors and kicking off a classic bank run. Worse, with algorithmic certainty, the UST. Bank run would be accelerated by a corresponding hyperinflation in Luna. This is exactly what happened. Just as the global capital market shocks of March and April 2020 drove sudden insatiable demand for US dollar liquidity, the shocks of April and May 2022 did as well. As the most levered risk assets crashed. USD liquidity demand skyrocketed. Andrea's systemic weaknesses were revealed. UST collapsed from one dollar to five cents, while Luna collapsed from a high of $116 to zero. And it's gone. Quote what do you mean you're going to pass? The only people making money passing are NFL quarterbacks, and I don't see a number on your back. Seth Davis Boiler pitching Luna on Twitter several sophisticated financial institutions profited enormously from this penny stock like pump and dump with old school boiler room promotional phone calls to unsuspecting retail buyers placed by look how cool I Am Twitter brags from the principles of the institutions propelling the pump. The institutions, of course, sold before the dump. Sadly, on behalf of Terra's retail believers, the wisdom of PT. Barnum has aged well. Sadly, on behalf of Terra's institutional exploiters the teachings of the Golden Rule have not. The common theme among the nine figure fortune makers was expert grounding in macro trading and deeper knowledge of currency pegs than their average Twitter disciple. Even the peg blowing hedge funds in 1992 for the British pound in 1997. The tie bot didn't pump the currencies of the pegs, they destroyed. A critique of the many current critiques of the UST luna debacle is that they merely represent after the fact, I told you so. Piling on that's false well in advance. Many commentators, including the authors, shared UST luna warnings via Twitter, blogs, private emails, and the masterpiece Only the Strong Survive, notably published in September 2021, which from first principles powerfully and presciently warned of forthcoming D Five blow ups. In the harrowing words of Harry marcopolis, no one would listen. So we'll repeat again in advance, no matter how well intentioned, all algorithmic stablecoins will fail. And the vast majority, possibly all of D fifty's current versions will fail. Where fail here means not gaining sufficient critical mass to matter being hacked, blowing up, or being altered by regulation to the point of non viability. In the end, the Tarot project could control the supply of its money, but it couldn't make its people value it. A printing press was the only non answer. Sound familiar? Lacking a lender of last resort, d Five recreates the problems solved by central banks. Bitcoin solves the problems created by central banks. The future is so bright, I got to wear shades. Tim buck three on DeFi. Scratch that. LiFi okay, let's take another break right here and talk about our sponsor. Now, I know that you are stacking like crazy, just like rad Swan here. This kid stacks like crazy, and he keeps his stats on his safe and secure and easy to use hardware wallet. The BigBox too, and he is only 17 days old. Now, I actually use the bitbox for a bunch of different setups lately. It's been my daily driver for quite some time, but it's also been great for my Android phone and for a number of my multi SIG setups. Now, I've included the bitbox, and they have a mobile and desktop app, which are just really super intuitive. They're easy to use. I'm a little picky about my hardware wallets, and there are only a handful that I really love, and the bitbox really shines. A solid hardware wallet with a proper backup is literally 99% of the securing your keys process of being sovereign. If you have a meaningful amount of capital in bitcoin and you have left it on an exchange, you have got to fix that, man. It's not that hard. Hold your own keys, invest in a safe, simple hardware device. It's not that complicated. It literally takes a few minutes to set it up, make your backup you're up and running, and just withdraw your bitcoin. The bitbox two is minutes away from bitcoin sovereignty. Just go to guyswan combatbox, takes you directly to the store codeguyguy, gets you 5% off everything. So grab your bitbox vault, get yourself some security goodies, get yourself 5% off, and become bitcoinslaughter again. Guyswan combitbox. All right, let's jump back into the piece. The future is so bright, I gotta wear shades. Tim buck three on D phi. Scratch that. LiFi imagine an ecosystem in which the building blocks of financial and capital markets are freely accessible to all without navigation of technical bottlenecks or economic middlemen in which their workings are transparently. inspectable and auditable on the basis of free and open source code in which the architecture of all marketplaces operate on these principles in which this constitution lends itself naturally to programmability at origin and interoperability thereafter. And in which. Due to the combination of the aforementioned factors. No individual or entity can maliciously or politically impact market activity in any form. Including advantaging themselves or disadvantaging others. The concept of decentralized finance is powerful, noble, and worthy of a lifetime of focused effort. Such a financial system would be censorship resistant and secure with collateral that is, collateral and sustainably low transaction fees. Yield would mean yield. Deposits would mean deposits.

      "text": "Now, in the spirit of getting ahead of the curve, and you've done this with Lightning for the last three or four years, you've been building on it. What are you most excited about for the next three or four years? What are you trying to get ahead of now in this, like Bitcoin adoption curve? Yeah. So I'm excited about a few trends. One is just the increasing robustness and growth of the Lightning network itself. I think a lot of people have a hard time reasoning about sort of the growth of networks and how fast that can happen. And if the lighting network continues on a trajectory, this exponential growth is going to make it orders of magnitude bigger than it is today over the coming years, which means millions and millions and millions of more people are going to be using this. So just the scale that it's going to get to is just very interesting and very fascinating, especially with a lot of little large onboarding platforms to Bitcoin starting to integrate the Lightning network. I'm also very excited about Taro or Taro. I think it's officially pronounced Taro, from what I've heard. I've been corrected. But I'm very excited, actually, about the assets on Lightning. I think that it's going to open up this whole new world of types of financial products that can be built. I think also Lightning is sort of at the forefront of what I call small footprint, like decentralized finance on Bitcoin. And what I mean by small footprint is, I mean, building financial products that only commit small amounts of information on chain, which is effectively what a Lightning channel does. Right. In contrast to the smart contract blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, et cetera, where they have this shared global state that's replicated worldwide and all nodes, run all computations and see all data. It's not private, it's not scalable, but it is easier. It's an easier programming model. Right. With Lightning, though, it's done the hard work of building the first sort of layer of this off chain financial world. And as it matures and as we get smarter about things, I think we'll see more than just payments being able to more financial products than just payments happening on Lightning and then layers above Lightning. And so when you think about having a small footprint on Chain, is the benefit of that just the Privacy component or is there another benefit that you see? There's a lot of benefits and there are some downsides. One benefit is Privacy. Absolutely. The only people who know about the state are the people who need to know about the state, the parties involved in the payment. In the example of Lightning network, that also makes a lot more anti fragile. Right. If there's some hiccup or some bad actor in that payment flow, it doesn't affect anybody else. If there's some catastrophic failure or some technical failure on one of the nodes involved in one payment channel, not fun for them, but everyone else is still fine. Whereas in contrast, if there's a flaw in the EVM, good luck. It's going to be an absolute nightmare to clean up because everyone's affected. So it keeps the types of catastrophic failure that can happen much more contained. And it's also way more scalable. Right. You can basically scale infinitely. Some of the downsides though, are because it's so private, because you don't have this global data set that everyone can see and agree on. Building more complex financial products is more challenging. Right. One big problem is like the matching problem or like the order book problem. Let's say you want to exchange in Ethereum. Right? You have like uni swap where you have these. It's easy to build an on chain exchange to swap assets in Bitcoin land. If you want to do something like this, you need people to agree on off chain transactions. You need to collect orders. And then if you match an order that both parties then need to sign that order before it could ever get actually posted. So then you get all these challenges with, okay, so then everyone, you can't have all this aggregated liquidity just like ready to go, ready to fill an order. You have to sort of do each order one by one in an interactive format. And so it just opens up the door to a lot of more complexity and challenges there. But I think they're solvable. So do you think there's a time where we do have some similar exchange order book system built on either Bitcoin or on Lightning? Maybe this is something that leverages Taro. So I actually think Taro is very interesting because of the decentralized exchange. It's going to facilitate. There's a number of ways that exchange can be accomplished in a Tarot world. So I think there's like a big debate. I think the biggest debate would be decentralized exchange for altcoins and stuff on Bitcoin. Let's not even talk about that. I think there's one trading pair everyone can agree is useful, which is dollars in Bitcoin. Right. So let's say there's a stable coin on Taro. Right. And for those listeners who don't know what Taro is, it's basically this way to represent offchain or just tokens, arbitrary assets on Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain using tap root outputs that are also transferable off chain on Lightning. Right. So the way this would work is, let's say I wanted to create a dollar coin. I could create like, say, river dollars. Right. And we have a bank account. If you give us dollars, we give you a river dollar on chain. And then if you have river dollar channels, you can transfer these dollars to anyone else, to anyone you can find a path to. What's cool is that not only can you transfer these dollars on lightning, you can atomically swap the dollars for Bitcoin on lightning with other parties and vice versa, which means you can trade Bitcoin in dollars now through light. And so these trades can be facilitated through routing nodes. There's a few different modes of operation you can do to facilitate this decentralized exchange. But the long and the short of it is all of a sudden now you can have a Dex running off chain, which is kind of cool and. Powered by Bitcoin liquidity and powered by Bitcoin. And what you could even theoretically, this decentralized exchange can also be like implicit, it can be part of a routing, just part of a payment flow. So let's say, for example, that a merchant wants dollars. Right. Which is very reasonable. Most of the costs are still in dollars. So a lot of merchants still want dollars, but if they want to accept Bitcoin, they could actually accept the dollar payment over lightning. Let's say, Kevin, you have a Bitcoin channel with river and river has a dollar channel with the merchant. You want to buy something from the merchant in Bitcoin, the merchant wants to receive dollars. So you pay through us. We have a price that we convert at, and we route your payment initially from you to us comes via Bitcoin, and then from us to the merchant goes via us, river dollars or something like that. And we facilitated that trade. And there's a lot of interesting stuff like that that could happen. Yeah, ",

      "text": "This relates to something that you were telling me the other day, which is that a lot of people get confused about Snore because they think Chnore is just this big package that includes everything, when really Snore is just the specific signature scheme. And the rest of this are things that are built on top of that sort of require Snore as a prerequisite. Yeah, so I can elaborate on that a bit. So, as you say, Schnor is just a type of digital signature. It's an alternative to ecgsa. By itself, Schnor is not very interesting. It's a little bit faster to verify, but not very much faster. You can batch verify it, but you could actually batch verify like a variant of Eastern DSA. It has some nice linearity properties that you can do some cool stuff, but those cool things are not Snore. So if you get excited by Schnor by itself, you might do something like the Be Cash folks did and like go implement snort signatures, just the drop in replacement for ECDSA, except you don't do it for multi signatures because you haven't solved the multi signature related problems that you need to solve to get all the cool benefits and stuff. And the results are just kind of silly. Like you're just hard forking for the sake of hard forking and I don't know, demonstrates some sort of weird power trip about how you can make coins unspendable, but since you on the chain, you can just make them spendable again. And that's a perfectly reasonable governance model and that's what trust us means. So if your goal is to make insane claims like that, I mean, Be Cash has got you and they've got Snoring signatures to help out. But if your goal is any of the cool things that we've been talking about in the media that have been associated with Snor, those are things that require Snor to work. They're sort of extensions or things that build on Schnore, but they themselves are not Snore. So let me talk about the big one that we recently had a bit draft or a proposal for a bit published to the Bitcoin mailing list by Peter. That was going to be my next question. Perfect. All right, first, I should say this is a joint workers primarily. Peter Willa, Greg Maxwell, AJ Towns and Johnson Lau are the big people behind this. I resolved and pop up and whine about things and complain that it's moving too slow. And then Interject was like, why can't you change all these things? And Psy, isn't it done, but please change these things. Russell O'Connor does this as well. There are a whole bunch of us who pop in and do this, but it's mostly those four. Peter Gray, AJ. J. O. And what taffford is it is a proposal to create a new SegWit output version or a new bitcoin output version, I shouldn't say Sega Play, it's just a new version of bitcoin outputs using the versioning system that Segwa introduced, where every output, instead of being described by a script you remember I just talking about bitcoin script. You can do all these cool things. Instead of having a script, you have a public key, okay? And to spend the coin, you have to produce a signature with a public key. And this brings us to the intuitive model that most people have a bitcoin where like every coin has a key. To spend the coin, you just sign with the key. But wait, you might be saying if that's what we're reducing these outputs to, that's ridiculous. You just spent half an hour talking about Miniscript and how you can do all these cool things. How can you do that if now you just produce signatures? The cool thing is that it is possible to efficiently interactively produce schnoar signatures. So you can have a schnoar signature that has a public key that is actually jointly controlled by multiple people. You could have, like this, two or three output that are very common for various escrow and counter signing services. And you can have the three counter parties, at least the two counterparties and some cold keys somewhere. You jointly create a key that's a combination of all of these and it's just a single key. And then you can interactively create what's called a threshold signature, where any pair of those three people can come together and interactively produce a signature that will verify with the original key. And it's just an ordinary store signature. So what the signature will be from the perspective of blockchain Verifier, is the same as an ordinary person suspending their coins as if they'll see one public key that see one signature. So you can get thresholds this way, and in fact, you can get arbitrary combinations, arbitrary and ors of different signature requirements. You can get just using these interactive signature generation schemes. And so this by itself gives you some of the power of bitcoin script, actually the most common part of the power of bitcoin script. And it gets you this in a very scalable, private way. Like you get a huge benefit from using tap root to do this, rather than using ordinary bitcoin script, which is that because the resulting signature is the same as an ordinary single sign of signature, it has the same size and the same verification cost as any other signature, both much cheaper. And you also get a privacy benefit. People verifying the blockchain can no longer distinguish signatures that were produced by a single person spending their coins from signatures that were produced by a two of three esco type service from signatures that are like eleven to 15 liquid spends. You can distinguish liquid transaction in a lot of ways, but you can't do it this way now. Or signatures that are countersigned by Bitcoin or other companies or Casa, or like somebody who maybe you can imagine a service that wants to do counter signing, but they want their customers don't want to reveal their using this counter signing services only for people who are very widely known targets. You can do this in a way that it would be invisible to the blockchain that you are using the service. So you get the scalability benefits and you get the privacy benefits. Multi signatures, okay, but there are other things Bitcoin script can do. What about hash primitives? What about, like I mentioned how lightning works, where you have one party reveals some sort of secrets to the blockchain and the other party copied it off the blockchain and transferred it and transferred it. It turns out you can do this with tap root as well. So there's something called an adapter signature. So again, you notice I'm not using the word Snore signature. Before I was talking about threshold signatures. Now I'm talking about adaptive signatures. They all look to the blockchain like their Snore signatures, but like they're really different things. They're produced in fundamentally different ways. An adoptive signature is a type of multi signature where you have two parties and you can generalize this. Adam Gibson has a way to do this with many parties. But the two party case is the most straightforward, where one party produces, contributes to a signature, like some signatures going to hit the blockchain. And they do so in a way where the other party promises them that when they complete the signature and publish to the blockchain, by completing the signature, they reveal some secret. And the way they do this is there's an interactive protocol where basically the first party thinks of some secret, they encrypt the signature to their final signature and pass that to the first party. And at this point the original party can free to sign like, okay, you can have your coins, I will sign to give you your coins. And it's part of some wider protocol where you don't want to give the other guy his coins unless you know you're going to get this hash premature, right? But because the other guy gave you this encrypted version of this hash premiere, you're fine. You signed to give him his coins, you give him a signature, he makes his own signature, adds that to the final signature, published it to the blockchain. You look at the blockchain, you see the signature, and you do some crazy algebra and you're able to extract a secret. This works like a hash pre image. You get a secret out of the signature. You can then use that to produce a different signature and go through. The chain and link a whole bunch of liquid transactions this way and actually doing it this way. Instead of using hash, premises has a bunch of other benefits, other privacy benefits. You can rebuild it at every step so that even if you have the same party and multiple parts of a lightning path, that party can't then link the payments and be able to deononomize people that way. So now we have hash prematures. We've got multi signatures and arbitrary signatures. We've also got hash pre images that you can also do where the results are just a single signature. So now you can do much more elaborate and you can do not only like escrow and multi signatures, but you can also do lightning in a way that the resulting outputs just have a key. You spend them with a signature. We've offloaded all of the script kind of stuff, adjusting to these signatures. And so the third piece of mini script, I guess, of what people use bitcoin scripts for are these time locks. And doing these in a purely signature sense is very difficult. And I don't really have time to go into some of the research and how to do this, but let's just say that you can't do it. Let's say you have to use script. Or let's say that you don't want to produce signatures interactively because you have somebody who has a key, like in a safe, and you can only access the safe at midnight on the full moon with three werewolves present out like a specific cemetery and nobody else. How did you find out? My keys. I'm going to have to go fix my security now. You are? Yes. I'm afraid it's been compromised. Yeah, no, there was dirt on the back of your shoe and I was able to recognize that exact form of dirt attacks. Exactly. And moonlight as a detective in a mystery novel. Well, lizards can do mind reading as well, so it all makes sense. Well, we're not supposed to talk about that. Plus, you guys just control bitcoin so you know where all the coins are anyway. That's true, but it's still knowing where all the bitcoins are, even when they're buried in a cemetery. That's hard because that's actually the one way I shouldn't admit that's the one way to hide your coin from blockchain, from blockstream is to bury it in a haunted cemetery. Let me get back to what I was saying. Berlin we're mapping out all the cemeteries. That's the real conspiracy. You don't want to use interactivity, okay? Because you've got like, people with their signing keys and some of the cold storage is difficult to access, and maybe not everybody can access it at the same time. Or maybe you want auditability, you want individual signatures on the blockchain so you can see who exactly signed. This annoys me. Because you're using blockchain space for your own personal means, but that people want to do this then you need to go back to bitcoin script. And here is really the cool innovation of tap root or the second half of what's cool about tap root. The first half is like, look, you can do all these things and you just need a signature. The second half is that we can take an arbitrary script, like a mini script, or like, we have a slight extension to bitcoin script, we call tap script, where we fixed a couple of words that we didn't like in script. And you can take your public key and you can turn that into a commitment to this alternate script. So if you have. Say. Some coins where you're willing to do the interactive thing. But you need a time lock. You need to say like. After some amount of time. Maybe the counterparties have disappeared and we need to do this backup thing. Then you can reveal the script. You can prove that this public key committed to the script so that you didn't just make it up. You're not just stealing the coins. And then the script has all the thematic feed, it has the time lock, it has the alternate keys, it has whatever, like weird branches and stuff that you have in the unhappy case, you review the script and then you satisfy it just the same as ordinary bitcoin. But if you don't need to use this, if you can actually like, everybody's online and willing to sign at the same time interactively, then you don't reveal the script and nobody even learns that the script is there at all. So for things like Lightning, where you need to have some sort of script for this backup emergency policy, you can still have it there. You have it committed inside of the tap group key and you just never reveal it unless you're doing an uncooperative close is the idea. So you get the expressivity and the flexibility of having these explicit scripts, but you still retain all of your privacy in the case that you don't have to use it. And in most cases, there is kind of a happy case where everybody's online at the same time and you just don't have to reveal it. Choose your peers carefully. Find reliable peers who are going to cooperatively. Yeah, exactly. And then like the cases where this isn't really possible, a case of cold wallets where really you aren't moving coins very often anyway. So the added inefficiency of revealing the script is not as big a cost to you and the added privacy loss is not as big as cost to you. All your normal day to day transactions are happening on the Lightning network and those transactions never revealed it's all in the script. They never revealed their Lightning payments versus any other kind of payment. So that's the taproot is it gives us a way to do all the things that people are using script for, where in the most common cases, all of these different applications of script all kind of turn into just a public key and a signature. They're indistinguishable from application, but people aren't using script. So that's very exciting for scalability and for efficiency, of verifier efficiency. And it's also super exciting for privacy and fungibility because it means that all of the coins that are actively moving around once people start using us will be basically indistinguishable from each other.

          "text": "This relates to something that you were telling me the other day, which is that a lot of people get confused about Snore because they think Chnore is just this big package that includes everything, when really Snore is just the specific signature scheme. And the rest of this are things that are built on top of that sort of require Snore as a prerequisite. Yeah, so I can elaborate on that a bit. So, as you say, Schnor is just a type of digital signature. It's an alternative to ecgsa. By itself, Schnor is not very interesting. It's a little bit faster to verify, but not very much faster. You can batch verify it, but you could actually batch verify like a variant of Eastern DSA. It has some nice linearity properties that you can do some cool stuff, but those cool things are not Snore. So if you get excited by Schnor by itself, you might do something like the Be Cash folks did and like go implement snort signatures, just the drop in replacement for ECDSA, except you don't do it for multi signatures because you haven't solved the multi signature related problems that you need to solve to get all the cool benefits and stuff. And the results are just kind of silly. Like you're just hard forking for the sake of hard forking and I don't know, demonstrates some sort of weird power trip about how you can make coins unspendable, but since you on the chain, you can just make them spendable again. And that's a perfectly reasonable governance model and that's what trust us means. So if your goal is to make insane claims like that, I mean, Be Cash has got you and they've got Snoring signatures to help out. But if your goal is any of the cool things that we've been talking about in the media that have been associated with Snor, those are things that require Snor to work. They're sort of extensions or things that build on Schnore, but they themselves are not Snore. So let me talk about the big one that we recently had a bit draft or a proposal for a bit published to the Bitcoin mailing list by Peter. That was going to be my next question. Perfect. All right, first, I should say this is a joint workers primarily. Peter Willa, Greg Maxwell, AJ Towns and Johnson Lau are the big people behind this. I resolved and pop up and whine about things and complain that it's moving too slow. And then Interject was like, why can't you change all these things? And Psy, isn't it done, but please change these things. Russell O'Connor does this as well. There are a whole bunch of us who pop in and do this, but it's mostly those four. Peter Gray, AJ. J. O. And what taffford is it is a proposal to create a new SegWit output version or a new bitcoin output version, I shouldn't say Sega Play, it's just a new version of bitcoin outputs using the versioning system that Segwa introduced, where every output, instead of being described by a script you remember I just talking about bitcoin script. You can do all these cool things. Instead of having a script, you have a public key, okay? And to spend the coin, you have to produce a signature with a public key. And this brings us to the intuitive model that most people have a bitcoin where like every coin has a key. To spend the coin, you just sign with the key. But wait, you might be saying if that's what we're reducing these outputs to, that's ridiculous. You just spent half an hour talking about Miniscript and how you can do all these cool things. How can you do that if now you just produce signatures? The cool thing is that it is possible to efficiently interactively produce schnoar signatures. So you can have a schnoar signature that has a public key that is actually jointly controlled by multiple people. You could have, like this, two or three output that are very common for various escrow and counter signing services. And you can have the three counter parties, at least the two counterparties and some cold keys somewhere. You jointly create a key that's a combination of all of these and it's just a single key. And then you can interactively create what's called a threshold signature, where any pair of those three people can come together and interactively produce a signature that will verify with the original key. And it's just an ordinary store signature. So what the signature will be from the perspective of blockchain Verifier, is the same as an ordinary person suspending their coins as if they'll see one public key that see one signature. So you can get thresholds this way, and in fact, you can get arbitrary combinations, arbitrary and ors of different signature requirements. You can get just using these interactive signature generation schemes. And so this by itself gives you some of the power of bitcoin script, actually the most common part of the power of bitcoin script. And it gets you this in a very scalable, private way. Like you get a huge benefit from using tap root to do this, rather than using ordinary bitcoin script, which is that because the resulting signature is the same as an ordinary single sign of signature, it has the same size and the same verification cost as any other signature, both much cheaper. And you also get a privacy benefit. People verifying the blockchain can no longer distinguish signatures that were produced by a single person spending their coins from signatures that were produced by a two of three esco type service from signatures that are like eleven to 15 liquid spends. You can distinguish liquid transaction in a lot of ways, but you can't do it this way now. Or signatures that are countersigned by Bitcoin or other companies or Casa, or like somebody who maybe you can imagine a service that wants to do counter signing, but they want their customers don't want to reveal their using this counter signing services only for people who are very widely known targets. You can do this in a way that it would be invisible to the blockchain that you are using the service. So you get the scalability benefits and you get the privacy benefits. Multi signatures, okay, but there are other things Bitcoin script can do. What about hash primitives? What about, like I mentioned how lightning works, where you have one party reveals some sort of secrets to the blockchain and the other party copied it off the blockchain and transferred it and transferred it. It turns out you can do this with tap root as well. So there's something called an adapter signature. So again, you notice I'm not using the word Snore signature. Before I was talking about threshold signatures. Now I'm talking about adaptive signatures. They all look to the blockchain like their Snore signatures, but like they're really different things. They're produced in fundamentally different ways. An adoptive signature is a type of multi signature where you have two parties and you can generalize this. Adam Gibson has a way to do this with many parties. But the two party case is the most straightforward, where one party produces, contributes to a signature, like some signatures going to hit the blockchain. And they do so in a way where the other party promises them that when they complete the signature and publish to the blockchain, by completing the signature, they reveal some secret. And the way they do this is there's an interactive protocol where basically the first party thinks of some secret, they encrypt the signature to their final signature and pass that to the first party. And at this point the original party can free to sign like, okay, you can have your coins, I will sign to give you your coins. And it's part of some wider protocol where you don't want to give the other guy his coins unless you know you're going to get this hash premature, right? But because the other guy gave you this encrypted version of this hash premiere, you're fine. You signed to give him his coins, you give him a signature, he makes his own signature, adds that to the final signature, published it to the blockchain. You look at the blockchain, you see the signature, and you do some crazy algebra and you're able to extract a secret. This works like a hash pre image. You get a secret out of the signature. You can then use that to produce a different signature and go through. The chain and link a whole bunch of liquid transactions this way and actually doing it this way. Instead of using hash, premises has a bunch of other benefits, other privacy benefits. You can rebuild it at every step so that even if you have the same party and multiple parts of a lightning path, that party can't then link the payments and be able to deononomize people that way. So now we have hash prematures. We've got multi signatures and arbitrary signatures. We've also got hash pre images that you can also do where the results are just a single signature. So now you can do much more elaborate and you can do not only like escrow and multi signatures, but you can also do lightning in a way that the resulting outputs just have a key. You spend them with a signature. We've offloaded all of the script kind of stuff, adjusting to these signatures. And so the third piece of mini script, I guess, of what people use bitcoin scripts for are these time locks. And doing these in a purely signature sense is very difficult. And I don't really have time to go into some of the research and how to do this, but let's just say that you can't do it. Let's say you have to use script.

      "text": "Do you think that earnings that right now is a constraint on geyser? Because it's something that I've come to realize being pretty close to a number of startups in the lightning space is that it seems like one of the biggest problems is actually getting stats in people's hands so they can then use them on the lightning network. Like Bitcoin errs who have never experienced lightning may have SATS in cold storage. Maybe you don't want to use it, maybe don't want to sling it around for tax reasons or whatever. There's a number of reasons why you wouldn't want to start slinging things around, creating new wallets and whatever. But do you think that we have enough people today with SADS in their hands to build this critical mass and get this economy going, the circular economy spinning? Or is that something that you guys are prioritizing getting more stats in more people's hands today. We've thought about this. I think you're right. First of all, people like playing around with money that they received for free. They think about it less probably, even if there is some barrier and people want to Stack SATS. Like I said previously, they don't spend their Bitcoin well. You still have to find the things that they value for them to spend it. So giving away some stats is a nice way to take away that concern and have them play around with the platform. And we've thought about ways we could distribute some sites to people, maybe on a weekly basis or on a monthly basis based on perhaps sponsorship that we accumulate and then let people split the funds from the sponsorships and we let people play around with the platform. Then I think we need to explore this a little bit more. And there's probably ways we haven't even thought about it. And I'm curious if you have anything in mind but earn to play or play to earn is something that we'd love to bring into Geyser, but that is not directly linked to crowdfunding. Yeah, that's really interesting. There's going to be a lot of new ways to earn money on Lightning. We are in the beginning of the first inning right now. It's just like we have this now. It's liquid money. It can flow anywhere between anyone, any parties on Lightning network. There are so many possibilities for how money can move. It's hard to say exactly how that's going to end up. But all I know is that I think we need more people earning today. And I think that's actually an easier way to get people to Lightning is by earning it rather than having them go through the process of learning about Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin, store Bitcoin, move it to Lightning, then spend the Bitcoin that you've just learned you should never spend, you should hold onto forever. That's a painful process and it's a long process. Of course, just look at Fold, right? I think Fold is a genius product. Just for that, you're spending your dollars and you're getting sets back and then you're accumulating those SATS. And right now, I don't think Fold is partnering with anyone to actually let users use those sites, but I can definitely see that happening in the future. And this idea that they're giving away stats is nice, but it's also not very sustainable if you find a sustainable way to do it. And I believe Stacker News is on something here because they've got their revenues from Ads and then they redistribute to their users and you get some stats rolling in every day and that incentivizes you to use the platform. That's a pretty genius model. There's going to be more of that. That's one great example of how you can use how you can sustainably get SATS into the community's hands like it's a flywheel, and it's just going to spin it faster and faster, and there's going to be more companies that learn about it and figure out how to implement it in their own products. But that one is definitely picking up steam. And you can see the amounts people are sending in on Stack or News. The changes. Like, my first ten posts in November, I earned 85 SATS. For my last ten posts in April, I earned 1877 stats. 25. It can become an income, right? So it brings you back onto the platform. And this is with, like, they've got like 310 monthly active registered users on the platform right now. I just think about what happens when it gets to 310,000 or 310,000,000, and you have this big flywheel churning where advertisers can come in with their maybe they can even come in with their Fiat money and they just send it and it gets injected into the network and it gets blasted out to all the users in proportion to how much they contribute. That's the key. It's not every user gets the same amount. So there's that element, too, that I think is going to be really helpful in rewarding quality users. But yeah, there's so much experimentation to be done here. This is just the beginning of the beginning, for sure. And then comes the interoperability of the services. So these Satoshi are still Satoshi. They're not static. I can use points. So they're not locked in within the ecosystem of that website. They can actually interact with all the other ecosystems, and that benefits everyone in the end, the user base of Cycle news that is growing. As we said previously, if the users want to determine a few grants or a few projects that they want to earn Satoshi to flow to, that could be Bitcoin development. It could be a particular project they've spotted on Geyser. It could be humanitarian aid, it could be anything. You can redistribute those stats just because they were sad, because this is all the lightning network and because this is all within the same ecosystem. Yeah, 100%. I think it makes sense that companies start to partner with each other in this regard. Where you have maybe there's some companies where people are earning SATS and one where people are spending SATS. Like, guys are maybe one where people spend SATS. And if fold is one where people are earning SATS, it makes sense to link those two together, because then you can turn like a company flywheel. It's not a flywheel within one company. It's one within the whole ecosystem. And there are many companies that are on both sides letting you earn and letting you spend. And then you can kind of like tie them together in the right ways. Yeah. You can quickly see how that grows really fast. And there's more to that. This is about just Satoshi, but I think another aspect that people value is proving that they've done something. And I don't want to get into the whole token thing because that's not my vibe. But showing that you funded a project or that you were part of an early user in the stack and use base, or you've achieved something, that is something you also want to showcase. And when you have an ecosystem where satoshis are flowing freely between each other, then why not also showcase those accomplishments? And maybe those accomplishments are valued in some way as well. So how do you think those accomplishments? What are some of the ways that you think they could be represented? Is this like a token on Lightning? Is this some kind of like badge? What does that look like in your mind? Right. I think that's where the current Tarot announcement from a couple of days ago by Lightning Labs is going to bring a lot of attention, or RGB, if that picks up, or Omni or whichever solution brings that to Lightning because the key is making it interoperable it's, making it usable within the same network without needing a bridge, without needing a token sale or anything like that. The idea is not to have a speculative asset, it's to showcase something you've done within an ecosystem. ",

That's one great example of how you can use how you can sustainably get SATS into the community's hands like it's a flywheel, and it's just going to spin it faster and faster, and there's going to be more companies that learn about it and figure out how to implement it in their own products. But that one is definitely picking up steam. And you can see the amounts people are sending in on Stack or News. The changes. Like, my first ten posts in November, I earned 85 SATS. For my last ten posts in April, I earned 1877 stats. 25. It can become an income, right? So it brings you back onto the platform. And this is with, like, they've got like 310 monthly active registered users on the platform right now. I just think about what happens when it gets to 310,000 or 310,000,000, and you have this big flywheel churning where advertisers can come in with their maybe they can even come in with their Fiat money and they just send it and it gets injected into the network and it gets blasted out to all the users in proportion to how much they contribute. That's the key. It's not every user gets the same amount. So there's that element, too, that I think is going to be really helpful in rewarding quality users. But yeah, there's so much experimentation to be done here. This is just the beginning of the beginning, for sure. And then comes the interoperability of the services. So these Satoshi are still Satoshi. They're not static. I can use points. So they're not locked in within the ecosystem of that website. They can actually interact with all the other ecosystems, and that benefits everyone in the end, the user base of Cycle news that is growing. As we said previously, if the users want to determine a few grants or a few projects that they want to earn Satoshi to flow to, that could be Bitcoin development. It could be a particular project they've spotted on Geyser. It could be humanitarian aid, it could be anything. You can redistribute those stats just because they were sad, because this is all the lightning network and because this is all within the same ecosystem. Yeah, 100%. I think it makes sense that companies start to partner with each other in this regard. Where you have maybe there's some companies where people are earning SATS and one where people are spending SATS. Like, guys are maybe one where people spend SATS. And if fold is one where people are earning SATS, it makes sense to link those two together, because then you can turn like a company flywheel. It's not a flywheel within one company. It's one within the whole ecosystem. And there are many companies that are on both sides letting you earn and letting you spend. And then you can kind of like tie them together in the right ways. Yeah. You can quickly see how that grows really fast. And there's more to that. This is about just Satoshi, but I think another aspect that people value is proving that they've done something. And I don't want to get into the whole token thing because that's not my vibe. But showing that you funded a project or that you were part of an early user in the stack and use base, or you've achieved something, that is something you also want to showcase. And when you have an ecosystem where satoshis are flowing freely between each other, then why not also showcase those accomplishments? And maybe those accomplishments are valued in some way as well. So how do you think those accomplishments? What are some of the ways that you think they could be represented? Is this like a token on Lightning? Is this some kind of like badge? What does that look like in your mind? Right. I think that's where the current Tarot announcement from a couple of days ago by Lightning Labs is going to bring a lot of attention, or RGB, if that picks up, or Omni or whichever solution brings that to Lightning because the key is making it interoperable it's, making it usable within the same network without needing a bridge, without needing a token sale or anything like that. The idea is not to have a speculative asset, it's to showcase something you've done within an ecosystem. ",

      "text": "let's go to the second category, liquidity Marketplaces. And this is something where you have players like Amboss, you have players like LM plus Lightning Pool. You have liquidity ads from Core Lightning. And this seems to be my take on it right now, is that it seems to be like it's a network effect waiting to form. Like we have a few variations of these marketplaces, but it seems like there's going to be strong network effects that develop over time. Do you think this is going to be kind of a winner take? Most market, kind of like if you look to DeFi maybe like a uniswap where they kind of like aggregate a lot of the liquidity on DFI. Maybe, I think there's going to be at least two big players and I could see making the case for more. So to take a step back, why do think liquidity marketplaces are a big deal? Roy the founder of Breeze, which I'm investor and I love that company, roy has put out some great articles around. Like one of those articles is actually called the Lighting Network is the Liquidity Network. And I think it's really important for people to understand what that means. So not to go all the way to how Lightning works, but essentially when you send payments on the light network, I like his example of it's an advocacy with beads to say, I want to route a payment to a mutual friend, Kian. I don't have a channel open with him, but I have a channel open to you. You channel Kian. I sent some beads your way, you send some beats his way, you take a small fee for routing. If he was just coming on the network and all the beads, he only had a chance with you and all the beads are on your side, then that's a huge problem because he can't send out a payment. And I highly encourage anyone to read more about how this works. There's a great book called Mastering Light Network by Andreas. It's not as low, Renee, you can learn more about this. But the high level takeaway is liquidity is the scarce resource in the Lightning network, the beads that you're shooting back and forth, particularly for new users that are coming on the network. And so that is the scarce resource. And typically the scarce resource is the valuable thing. And so marketplaces for the valuable things are going to be valuable. That's kind of my very simple take on it. And so I think it's very early, I think it's way too early to call any kind of winners, any one I see a couple of interesting things for me. So I think in terms of early network effect, I am an investor in Network Plus and I invest there because I started to see that network warming on their site, they're claiming 760 BTC volume done, something like that. It's insane. And so there I think, have some pretty strong early network effects, certainly among the Plebs. And in some ways it's kind of like it's more peer to peer. It's not the perfect Craigslist analogy, I know, and Boss is going to use that as well right now, which is a bit more of a market buy and sell. But that's certainly where the Plebs are sourcing liquidity for now. And part of it is because it's free and it remains big me monetized, et cetera. But it does have early network effects is my view. And so I think that's really interesting. In a site like that, I think it's also important to understand who's using it and why. And so what a lot of people forget here is that early bitcoiners that got here in 2011. These people are institutions themselves, many of them are billionaires, and so they're sitting on tremendous amounts of capital. And if they got in that early, they were highly technical. And so they can certainly run around nodes, they can certainly manage liquidity, et cetera, et cetera. And so for folks like that, I think they kind of prefer some of these easy sites don't require a whole lot of information or whatever. And so I think like Network Plus has just been huge for them and that's I can't confirm this, but that's why I would guess why it has such really strong network effects, right? Go ahead. Yes. I was also going to say. Though. I love a product like Lightning Labs Pool. Also investors like Labs. And I think for them especially as they start onboarding more institutions and obviously there's a bunch of exciting stuff. Ataro or Tarot. However you say it. I think that Lightning Labs Pool is like a pretty obvious answer for some of the older financial institutions and the real huge amounts of capital that they're going to bring to bear. And so I would also be pretty bullish on them. I also like a lot inbox their new liquidity marketplace. I like that it's also peer to peer and they make it easy just to click buy them. Adding the API was extremely smart. I think a lot of people are going to build cool apps around that. In fact, I saw one of the Bitcoin Plus hackathon that I liked a lot, and so I think that's awesome. And then I think you're going to see new players come into the space that basically build aggregators on top of all of these marketplaces and try and drop that liquidity for you. So the analogy there in DeFi, I guess a little bit would be like unicorn became the dominant decks for centralized exchange, and then you had I forgot the names, like one X or something like that. All these things on top of the aggregation there remains to be seen in the long run, were a valuable crew if these ecosystems survive. But I think the same thing here for liquidity and the peer to peer liquidity ads from Sea Lightning, I think, or Blockchain or Lightning as well, too. Yeah. So now if you had to pick just one, I know I'm asking you to pick favorites here, but if you had to find one of these liquidity marketplaces and said, I'm going to put everything behind that, I'm going to back that as the dominant liquidity marketplace in a decade, what's your sense today, man? It's early. I mean, again, I think the network effects for Lightning Network Plus are very strong early on, but not too early that they keep instructed. Lightning Labs just have the best team by far. I mean, I'm a huge fan of Ellen Plus, but I don't think there's any question that Lalu and the team that Elizabeth is assembled over there is just a plus plus. So I would not bet against Lighting Labs, that's for sure, and I think particularly for onboarding some of the larger institutions. But again, I kind of see that there's a world where there are certain players, there are certain features that you may or may not be able to offer depending on who you're catering to. And so I don't think it's going to be winners ticks all depending on who you are, what you're willing to share or not. If we look at all these liquidity marketplaces and compare them to, let's say, web to marketplaces for various goods and services, those have traditionally been pretty good businesses. Is it fair to say that the returns for an investor and the margins for these businesses could be comparable? That's a good question. I don't know. My guess is that, again, because this is open, margins will probably be lower in general. I don't know that for a fact. I haven't thought much about this, but my guess would be margins are generally lower because of it's open. Who knows, maybe in the day these marketplaces are actually not valuable at all. And maybe just like pure liquidity ads brings everything to zero. I can totally see that too. So too early to say. My hunches in general with open systems, lower take rates, but larger pies. I hope you're enjoying the show so far. I just want to give a quick shout out to our sponsor, Voltage. Voltage is the industry standard for Lightning network infrastructure, creating layer two applications and services. On top of bitcoin starts with Voltage, where you can spin up nodes, get access to liquidity, optimize your node, and much more.
